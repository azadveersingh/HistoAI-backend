Eighteen-Fifty-Seven and Its Many Histories 
Sekhar Bandyopadhyay 
WHAT happened in the year 1857 in large parts of northern and 
central India has been given many names - some thought it was 
a ""mutiny"" of the sepoys of the British Indian Army; others 
believed it to be a ""popular revolt"" of the civilian population. William Dalrymple has recently used the term ""Uprising"". 1 Eric 
Stokes, one of the foremost historians of 1857, has convincingly 
argued that it was not one movement but many;2 so any one 
name possibly will not suffice. Yet, the names only signal the 
kind of meaning we intend to impute into this history. In the last 
150 years almost every aspect of this history has been contested, 
re-imagined and re-invented for their presentist use. It is there­
fore one of the most written about episodes oflndian history. In 
1998 Vipin Jain published an annotated bibliography on the 
""Indian mutiny"" - as it is more popularly known in the interna­
tional historical literature. He listed 1,172 printed books in 
European languages, 369 articles from journals and periodicals 
and 108 works of fiction. 3 And that list is now already about nine 
years out of date, and we may add to that the ever growing 
number of books and articles written in Indian regional lan­
guages. In these years the debates on 1857 have progressed 
further and the present book is yet another contribution to that 
ongoing dialogue. However, what is important about this book 
is that the essays here do not represent any homogeneous view 
and therefore shed light on a variety of contested issues and 
epistemological positions.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=3

ongoing dialogue. However, what is important about this book 
is that the essays here do not represent any homogeneous view 
and therefore shed light on a variety of contested issues and 
epistemological positions. And the essays deal with not just 
what happened in 1857, but also with how those events have 
been remembered, reinvented, memorialised and put to 
presentist use. What is interesting about the history of 1857 is that it has been 
claimed by both the history of the empire as well as by the
2

history of nationalism, and as Dipesh Chakrabarty mentions in 
this book, by the history of insurgency and popular protest as 
well. But none of these claims have gone uncontested or were 
ever considered as unproblematic. For example, the most 
immediate imperial interpretation of the revolt was that it was 
a Muslim conspiracy to restore the Mughal empire an allega­
tion which Syed Ahmed Khan countered almost immediately in 
a passionate pamphlet written in 1858. 4However, the more 
dominant imperial stereotype, as Peter Robb shows in his 
chapter in this book, was that it was primarily a mutiny of the 
sepoys, later joined by the unruly mob, taking advantage of the 
general breakdown of law and order. However, around the 
same time there were people like Benjamin Disraeli or Karl 
Marx who could see the element of ""national revolt"" in what was 
being commonly described as the ""military mutiny"".5 Several 
years later in 1864John Kaye wrote the official history of 1857, 
A History of the Sepoy War in India, 1857-58, and James 
Fitzjames Stephen, the conservative utilitarian ideologue of the 
empire, could immediately use it in defence of the empire. In 
what happened in India in that fateful year was for him evidence 
enough to show that no one in that. country ""had in him any 
power of improvement or any wish for it"". 6 Hence they needed 
the enlightening touch of the Raj! In the writings of Charles Ball, 
John Kaye and George Trevelyan the history of 1857 became 
the history of its suppression, a history of the valour and courage 
of the English race and the glory of the empire.7 Recently, Tony 
Balantyne has shown that even in far-off New Zealand the 
indigenous Maori population were being told the stories of how 
the mutiny was suppressed in India, with a not so covert 
message about the futility of resistance to the empire and its 
possible consequences.8",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=4

Savarkar by calling it the ""First War of Indian Independence"" 
inducted the history of 1857 into the narrative of nationalism. Jyotirmaya Sharma reminds us in a chapter in this book that the 
word ""first"" did not feature in the original title of Savarkar's 
book - it was a later day interpolation. Whether it was ""first"" or 
at all ""a war of independence"" has been hotly contested in the 
last one and half century. On the 150th anniversary of the event 
the government oflndia has officially endorsed the term - ""First
Eighteen-Fifty-Seven and Its Ma y Histories 3 
War of Independence""; but as the media reports suggest, that 
endorsement has not gone without contestation in the Indian 
Parliament. 9 It will therefore be worthwhile to look at some of 
those contentious issues related to that romantic year and how 
does this book contribute to its many histories. CAUSES 
First of all, what happened in 1857 and why did it happen? It is now commonly believed that first was the mutiny of the 
sepoys in the Bengal army and it was caused by the greased 
cartridge for the newly introduced Enfield rifles that replaced 
the older Brown Bess muskets. Rumours spread quickly that the 
cartridge was greased with cow and pig fat, which neatly fitted 
into a long circulating conspiracy theory that the colonial 
authorities were out to destroy the religion of all Indians and 
convert them into Christianity. So Mangal Pandey in Barrackpore 
first raised the banner of protest on March 29 by refusing to use 
the cartridge and firing at his European officers. He was 
apprehended, court marshalled and hanged in April and he 
thus became in the nationalist legends the first martyr patriot of 
the Indian mutiny, his sacrifice recently celebrated in a popular, 
but controversial film, M angal Pandey: The Rising, which Rochana 
Majumdar and Dipesh Chakrabarty have examined in this 
book.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=5

have shown, that nothing happened so suddenly in March .1857, 
nor was the defiance of Mangal Pandey directly related to what 
happened since May in large parts of central and northern 
India.10 
Indeed, it was for a long time that serious grievances were 
developing among the sepoys, as their privileges were gradually 
being curtailed and the expansion of the empire was putting on 
them extra burden of work, much of which went against their 
religious and caste susceptibilities. In November 1824 there was 
a fiercer mutiny in Barrackpore, when the sepoys refused to 
go to Burma, as crossing the 'kalapani', they feared, would 
compromise their caste status. The mutiny was suppressed with 
exemplary ruthlessness. But what historian Premansu 
Bandyopadhyay calls the ""First Sepoy Mutiny"" 11 remained un­
known in imperial or nationalist histories because it was a 
mutiny with limited aims, and not directed at the destruction of
4 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
British rule. Similar discontent was simmering in the 1830s in the 
Bengal army, as Seema Alavi has shown, because the caste 
and religious privileges of the high caste sepoys were being 
gradually cut back in the empire's attempt to have greater 
control over the sepoys' lives and families. 12 
Kausik Roy tells us in his essay in this book that such acts of 
defiance were not always punished, as scope for limited dissent 
was built i.nto the system. But what the sepoys in Meerut did on 
May 10 was not limited dissent and in that sense it was different 
from the individual defiance of Mangal Pandey. He was protest­
ing against the infringement of his caste privilege and his 
individual sacrifice did not immediately lead to a collective 
revolt. ""An accidental hero"", as Rudrangshu Mukehrjee has 
argued, Pandey came to represent all the rebels of 1857 more 
due to imperial construction. 13",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=6

sepoys in Meerut who took their defiance from limited dissent 
to the next step of collectively challenging British rule. They 
marched on to Delhi and on March 11 they compelled the 
ageing Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar to accept their 
leadership. The mutiny thus had its other reluctant hero, who 
provided it with the much needed political legitimacy. Towards the middle of the 19th century, the Indians and the 
British officers in the army barracks in India were living in two 
different worlds, their lives were sequenced by two different 
concepts of time, with less and less communication and inter­
action between the two. The zeal of the Evangelical missionaries 
(who started coming to India after 1813) and some of the British 
officers began to create insurmountable barriers of distrust and 
hatred between the two communities - in the army, as well as in 
the larger society. As practically the whole oflndia was now under 
British control, power bred arrogance. In the British bureau­
cracy there was now a sense of contempt for anything Indian. As they were ""absolute masters everywhere"", wrote one of them 
in 1857, ""restraint is cast away ... and [they display] a 
supercilious arrogance and contempt of the people. ""14Many 
Indians therefore legitimately believed that their religions and 
cultures were under threat and this explains numerous rumours 
that were going around in the army barracks that told of a 
conspiracy to destroy the religions of both the Hindus and 
the Muslims. Eighteen-Fifty-Seven and Its Many Histories 5 
But apart from the rise of Evangelical Christianity and the 
growing arrogance of their officers, the sepoys were also 
distressed by other wider causes. A sizeable section of the 
sepoys in the Bengal army 
about 75,000 of them - had been 
recruited from Awadh. The annexation of Awadh in 1856 and 
the summary settlement that followed finally broke the trust 
between the Company's government and the sepoys, who were 
once its trusted instruments of empire building. 15 However, it 
needs to be pointed out that not all the sepoys in the British army 
joined the mutiny. The Bombay and the Madras armies did not 
join; in the Bengal army, as Kaushik Roy points out in his essay, 
about 1,00,000 either joined the mutiny or deserted, while 
30,000 remained loyal.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=7

about 1,00,000 either joined the mutiny or deserted, while 
30,000 remained loyal. On the other hand, the Punjabi and 
Gurkha soldiers and the princely armies were used to suppress 
the rebellion. Even more complex and differentiated was the civilian revolt 
that followed the mutiny of the sepoys. First of all, many regions 
like Bengal, Punjab or entire south India - were not affected 
by what appeared to be a people's revolt in Awadh and North 
Western Provinces. In these regions the popular response was 
also differentiated as different groups of rural population were 
motivated by different sets of grievances. First, the princes were 
aggrieved because ofDalhousie's aggressive annexation policy. Thus Nana Sahib in Kanpur, Begum Hazrat Mahal in Awadh, 
Khan Bahadur Khan in Rohilkhand and Rani Lakshmibai in 
Jhansi became the legendary leaders of the popular rebellion. On the other hand, many other princes did not join and 
provided military assistance to the Company for the suppres­
sion of the rebellion. The other elements whose role is often 
considered crucial were the landed magnates or the over mighty 
'taluqdars' of Awadh and North-Western Provinces, who joined 
the rebellion as many of them had lost their land, their forts, 
their status and prestige due to successive land revenue settle­
ments of the previous era. rn But Eric Stokes17 has reminded us 
that not all of them had suffered, and some of them, the ""new 
magnates"", could indeed successfully manipulate the system

feudal elements in the rebellion has been emphasised by a

number of historians; including Stokes and Judith Brown, who

-just as Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced into its leadership by 
the sepoys, who needed their support to provide legitimacy to

shown that often the peasants and the artisans forced their 
reluctant and vacillating taluqdars into action. Many· of them 
still did not join the rebels, others surrendered when the British 
troops arrived. 20In North-Western Provinces too, many taluqdars 
remained passively loyal, others tried to halt the tide of 
discontent. 21 In other words, the decision to join the rebellion or 
to continue the rebellion was not always in the hands of the 
feudal leadership. There was a good deal of autonomous 
initiative on the part of the sepoys and the peasants. However, 
why the peasants joined the revolt remains another challenging 
question regarding the events of 1857. Almost from the very beginning of colonial rule diverse 
sections oflndian peasantry in different regions actively resisted 
various changes brought in by the new regime in land 
revenue administration and property relations. These peasant 
movements were of varying intensity and scale, involving 
numbers ranging from ""several thousand(s)"" to ""hundreds of 
thousands"" of peasants. The most important and widespread 
conflagration of all was of course the revolt of 1857, affecting 
an estimated area of 5,00,000 square miles. 22 The more con­
ventional wisdom is that high revenue demands, the inroads 
of moneylenders into the rural economy and large-scale dis­
possession of taluqdars as well as small landholders in Awadh 
and the North-Western Provinces resulted in ""taluqdar-peasant 
complementarity of interests""23 and provided the motivation 
for the civilian revolt, which, according to S B Chaudhuri, 
represented ""a common effort to recover what they had lost"". But once again Eric Stokes24 has alerted us to the complexities

could withstand the pressures of high revenue demands, while 
moneylenders were least interested in dry and backward 
areas where the revolt was quite intense. So it is difficult to
Eighteen-Fifty-Seven and Its Many Histories 7 
draw a direct correlation between economic factors and the 
intensity of the revolt in various regions. It was more a sense of 
relative deprivation and the power of caste and community ties 
('bhaiacharas') among various groups like the jats, rajputs, 
gujars or sayyids which became crucial factors in determining 
the intensity of the revolt. However, all the sections of the 
rural society were equally distressed by the aggressive 
preaching of the Christian missionaries and deeply distrustful of 
the social reform agenda of the colonial state. One could 
perhaps argue - tentatively - that the civilian population 
revolted for multiple reasons, but what united them was a 
common anxiety about their religion, which indeed defined 
their entire way of life. NATURE The nature of the mutiny of the sepoys and their relationship 
with the peasants is another contested issue of 1857. Rudrangshu 
Mukherjee argued in his book on Awadh that the sepoys were 
""peasants in uniform"" and now in rebellion against the state they 
shed their uniforms and seamlessly merged with the peasants. Their activities, he argued in a later essay on the sepoy mutiny, 
had all the ""features of peasant insurgency in the colonial 
period"". It was ""well planned"", with clearly defined decision­
making process through the panchayats; the targets were 
deliberately chosen to represent the property and person of 
their dominators. The mutinies ""were informed by a conscious­
ness of a project of power"" and therefore very smoothly they 
transformed into popular insurgency, as an aggrieved peasantry 
was ""waiting for the mutinies to initiate the uprising"". 25 However, 
this position has been questioned by Sabyasachi Dasgupta in his 
present essay in this book. The peasants were no longer 
peasants in uniform, because uniform itself, he argues, had 
transformed the sepoys into a new aspiring power elite of 
Indian society.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=10

them and the mutiny was an opportunity to carve out for 
themselves an autonomous space within the existing power 
hierarchy of traditional India, vis-a-vis the feudal elites as well 
as the common peasantry. They were indeed terror to all 
sections of society. But nevertheless, their own organisation was 
democratic, and hence if they had succeeded there would have

been no going back to the old regimes and in this sense their 
revolt was progressive. The imperial narratives of the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries made it quite explicit that in 1857-58 India witnessed 
a scale of violence unprecedented in the history of British India. And this violence was unparalleled because it was indiscrimi­
nate and was perpetrated on both sides - the colonisers and the 
colonised. However, how this violence is interpreted and 
emplotted in the subsequent retelling of 1857 constitute another 
interesting aspect of its contested history. The rebels wanted to 
destroy foreign/Christian rule, and whatever represented that 
oppressive regime became their targets of attack and these 
included sahibs, memsahibs, their children and their properties 
and whoever collaborated with them, like the local Christian 
converts and the Bengali babus - no one was spared. The worst 
recorded incidents were the Satichura Ghat massacre of June 27 
and the Bibighur massacre of July 15 - both at Kanpur. The 
British counter-insurgency also unleashed extraordinary amount 
of violence, including public hanging of rebels without any trial, 
blowing them off from cannons, burning whole villages on 
slightest suspicion of complicity and women and children were 
not spared either. In most of the colonial narratives of the events this counter­
insurgency violence is condemned as mindless and as some­
thing that the history of the civilised British regime had never 
witnessed before, but it is at the same time explained as 
senseless retribution provoked by the beastly massacres of 
Kanpur.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=11

the Kanpur massacre is condemned, it is also mentioned that it 
was in response to the reports ofBrigadier-GeneralJames Neil's 
atrocities during his march from Allahabad to Kanpur, indis­
criminately burning villages and hanging people. 26 It is interest­
ing to note that in some of the recent retelling of the events, such 
as Saul David's The Indian Mutiny 185 7 - Neil's activities find 
place in the chapter 'The Backlash' that follows the chapter 
'Satichura Ghat', which is explained in terms of Nana Sahib's 
infamous treachery, a theory which has been seriously ques­
tioned in many recent writings. 27 This emplotment gives a

and the colonised - the colonial violence is rationalised as 
retribution for Kanpur, ignoring the fact that Kanpur itself was 
a retaliatory act to Neil's atrocities! And David is not alone in 
explaining colonial violence as vengeance spurred by a sense of 
humiliation and injustice. 28 
Rudrangshu Mukherjee has recently looked at the issue of 
violence in 1857. In his view, the rebel violence represented an 
act of ""transgression"" as they broke the colonial rule's ""meticu­
lously constructed ... monopoly of violence"", which the colonised 
had experienced in their day-to-day lives over a century. What 
the rebels had done to the English civilians was actually 
replicating what had already been done to them by the British 
officers. The latter's harsh retaliatory acts represented a basic 
intolerance of the fact that a subject population who had been 
taught to fear had the temerity to challenge their rule. 29 However, 
Kaushik Roy in his essay in the present book situates this 
violence in a transnational trajectory of the history of warfare.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=12

Kaushik Roy in his essay in the present book situates this 
violence in a transnational trajectory of the history of warfare. In his view the ""limited war"" concept of 18th century Europe, 
where liabilities were limited and soldiers were motivated by 
financial considerations, was in the 19th century giving way to 
a new concept of ""people's war"", where soldiers were citizens 
and they were motivated by ideologies and moral concerns. In 
this new warfare the lines between the combatants and the 
civilians were gradually elided. In his reckoning the East India 
Company's territorial wars against the Indian princes in the 18th 
century were reminiscent of the European limited wars, while 
the ""mutiny"" that lasted from May 1857 to April 1859 signalled 
the coming of people's war, where violence was perpetrated 
against civilians by both the British and the rebels. There was 
nothing ""uniquely colonial"" in this violence, he thinks, because 
violence had ""an instrumental function"" for both the colonial 
state and the rebel regime for inflicting moral blows on each 
other. In this war, while the rebels were inspired by their religion 
and were questioning the legitimacy of the foreign rule, the British 
were motivated by a ""muscular Christianity and revenge"". To the British sense of injustice and vengeance one may add 
another act of transgression, i e, the alleged ""dishonour"" to 
British womanhood. ""What would India be without England? And what would the British Empire be without Englishwomen ?""30 The memsahibs in India represented national purity and the

India and in London. At Meerut, Delhi and Awadh, writes John

from its customary restraints"" .31 Although later inquiries re­

the ordinary women and men, both Indian and English. So far 
as the Englishwomen and men were concerned, the diaries and 
memoirs of survivors began to appear in print from 1858-59 and 
kept appearing until the beginning of the 20th century, catering 
for the avid readers at home and in India. Their pain and 
suffering were remembered and their sacrifices provided an 
additional justification for the tightening of the iron fist of the 
empire. What was forgotten however, as Dipesh Chakrabarty 
reminds us in his essay in this book, was the suffering and pain 
of the ordinary Indians, who were at the receiving ends of the 
atrocities perpetrated on them by both the rebel sepoys and the 
advancing British troops. A recent admirable attempt to recap­
ture their grief and misery is William Dalrymple's The Last 
Mughal (2006) which for the first time gives a touching and 
sensitive account of what happened in Delhi between May 11, 
1857 and its recapture by the British in September that year. The 
book has been criticised for drawing parallels with the post-9/11 
""clash of civilisations"" paradigm, which his own evidence 
clearly does not sustain. But the real significance of the book lies 
in the fact that it presents the events of 1857 as a human tragedy 
of epic proportions. Dalrymple's narrative is based on a set of documents, known 
as the ""Mutiny papers"", which are the notes and letters of 
complaints written in Urdu and Persian by the ordinary resi­
dents of Delhi. On the basis of these, he has reconstructed a day­
to-day account of the endless pain and miseries inflicted on the 
ordinary residents of Delhi, sandwiched between the two adver­
saries. The sepoys, when they descended on Delhi, indiscrimi­
nately killed the Europeans, including women and children. Eighteen-Fifty-Seven and Its Many Histories 11

Local Indian residents were not spared either, as their houses 
were raided and shops were looted by a desperate rebel army 
short of cash. Bahadur Shah Zafar, their poet emperor, watched 
helplessly. And then when the British army returned and took 
over the city, they too unleashed a reign of terror. Captured 
sepoys were just hanged - there was no time for trial. Other 
Delhi residents fled in fear; their houses were first looted and 
then razed to the ground. People were hanged indiscriminately 
on slightest suspicion of being sympathetic to the rebels. Villages were burned down when the British soldiers came 
looking for the rebels. And then there was the bizarre plan to 
demolish the 'whole city of Delhi as an ultimate act of retribu­
tion. By the time this was stopped, almost 80 per cent of the 
historic Red Fort had been destroyed. 33 In this violent upsurge was there really any role for an 
ideology, which Kaushik Roy alludes to? Peter Robb has 
revisited this issue in his essay in this book. The colonial theories 
ranged from a Muslim conspiracy to a Hindu revolt, to a 
reactionary movement of the old feudal elements. It was 
primarily a mutiny of a few misguided sepoys, which was taken 
advantage of by a corrupt dispossessed aristocracy, while the 
ignorant and innocent masses were duped into it. Kaye's works 
drew attention to Indian alienation from British rule, but that 
only provided an argument for improvement and better impe­
rial governance. But nationalist certainly it was not. Hundred 
years after the event, Indian historians sought to write 
more objective histories of 1857. Among them, S N Sen and 
R C Majumdar, while trying to retrieve objective history from 
the colonial archives, ended up with observations which were 
strikingly similar to those of some of the colonial observers 
quoted by Robb in this book. It was a mutiny joined by the 
lawless elements; it was neither national nor a war of 
independence. 34 lt was S B Chaudhury who indicated the 
possibility of a different interpretation, as he saw in the events 
of 1857 ""a real, if remote approach to the freedom movement 
of India of a later age"".35 This nationalist view was not accepted by the majority of 
professional historians for a long time.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=15

professional historians for a long time. By the 1960s, as Thomas 
Metcalf has argued, there was a greater consensus among 
historians that ""it was something more than a sepoy mutiny, but
12 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
something less than a national revolt"". 36Eric Stokes further 
complicated it by indicating the existence of many and not just 
one revolt37 and Chris Bayly argued that this Indian disunity 
actually played into the hands of the British. 38These interpreta­
tions implying a plurality of interests at play were however not 
based on any analysis of ideology. Because it was widely 
believed that there was no well constructed ideology in 1857, as 
the rebels lacked a vision for the future. Metcalf wrote: ""United 
in defeat, the rebel leaders would have fallen at each other's 
throats in victory"". 39 
However, from the 1990s there has been another remarkable 
shift in the historical interpretation of 1857. There is now a 
greater recognition that although there was no concept of a 
modern nation, the rebels' sense of space was certainly larger 
than their village or region. There was communication between 
the regions and in addition, what bound them together were 
freely floating rumours. What all the rebels shared was a 
rejection of the Company's rule, which they thought threatened 
their religion and caste that defined their entire existence. They 
fought for their 'deen' and 'dharam' and wanted to destroy 
anyone or anything that represented the British or the Chris­
tians, the latter often being euphemism for anything foreign. The rebels of 1857, according to this new interpretation, 
fought to restore a moral order that had been polluted by an 
obtrusive and overbearing foreign rule.40 The rebels' actions, 
writes Gautam Bhadra, were determined by their ""day-to-day 
experience of the authority of the alien state"". 41 They fought, as 
Ranajit Guha thinks, ""to recover what they believed to have 
been their ancestral domains"".",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=16

the events of 1857 ""a set of patriotic revolts"", trying to restore the 
""Indo-Mughal patrias within the broader constellation of Mughal 
legitimacy"".43This has been further developed by Rajat Ray. He 
emphasises the fact that in the revolt of 1857 the rebels con­
stantly referred to the people of India as the ""Hindus and 
Mussulmans of Hindustan"". This was not modern nationalism, 
Ray agrees, but in it he sees the inchoate ideas of a confederate 
nation. In his own words: ""It signified a confederation of two 
separate peoples bound together as one political unit by the 
shared perception of Hindustan as one land"". 44 
Swarupa Gupta further argues in her essay in this book that

this configuration of land and people and a sense of humiliation 
and disapprobation arising out of subjection to alien rule 
pervaded in latent or articulate forms in all classes and regions 
oflndia in 1857 - including even the Bengali intelligentsia. This 
is an interesting revision of the earlier ideas about the position 
of the Bengali middle classes vis-a-vis the revolt of 1857 - a 
position that was shared by historians on both sides of the 
ideological spectrum. For example, a leftist Benoy Ghose saw 
among these people only ""unequivocal condemnation of the 
rebels of 1857"" - a condemnation that emanated from ""their 
own class-interest"".45 Judith Brown at the other end also saw 
""loyalty"" among these educated Bengalis because of their 
""material interests"" and ""a deep, ideological commitment"" to 
the new order.46 A close reading of the Bengali newspapers and 
periodicals of this period however suggests that condemnation 
was never unequivocal, but rather full of emotional dilemmas, 
and if there was expression of loyalty, it was coming more from 
the head than from the heart. 47 And this spirit of 1857 - which 
broadly meant a disapproval and defiance of British rule -
would indeed take myriad forms. As Shashank Sinha shows in

of Chhotanagpur, this spirit of defiance could be seen in the

sudden surge in witch hunt. The adivasis could never accept the 
British ban on the practice that was so deeply embedded in their 
social consciousness and notions of cosmology; so, as the 
administration loosened in the wake of the mutiny of the sepoys, 
they tried to reclaim their rights. Sinha would regard this as a 
part of a long tradition of adivasi anti-colonial resistance move­
ments in the Chhotanagpur region. This recent historiography 
thus indeed signify a remarkable shift in our understanding and 
representation of 1857. AFTERMATH The most direct aftermath of the revolt of 1857, as Bernard 
Cohn has argued, was the resolution of the ambiguities sur­
rounding the issue of sovereignty in India. 48 The last Mughal 
emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar who still theoretically held sover­
eign power in India until 1857 was tried for ""treason"", found 
guilty and sent off to exile in Rangoon, where he died in 1862 
at the age of 87.49 In India the rule of the East India Company

185Z· Essays from Economic and Political Wcekry 
was ended by the Act for the Better Government of India passed 
in the parliament on August 2, 1858, declaring queen Victoria 
the new sovereign power in India. However, apart from that 
symbolic termination of the legal fiction of Mughal sovereignty, 
the events of 1857 had other lasting imprints on British imagina­
tion and British policies towards India and the Indians. Almost 
a year of bloody warfare made the Indians suspect in the eyes 
of the British, the mutiny being the ultimate act of breach of 
trust. If Kanpur represented an unpardonable act of betrayal on 
the part of Indians - ""so foul an act of treachery the world had 
never seen"" - such other acts of British bravery as the resistance 
to the siege of Residency in Lucknow stood as evidence of 
British tenacity and heroism and proved that they were the 
chosen few to rule the empire.50 This resulted in racial exclusivism both in Britain and in 
India.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=18

chosen few to rule the empire.50 This resulted in racial exclusivism both in Britain and in 
India. Michael Fisher in his essay in this book has shown how 
a more tolerant British attitude to Indians living in London 
suddenly came to be replaced by hostility provoked by racial 
and gendered stereotyping of Indian men, continually but­
tressed by stories and rumours about atrocities in 1857. The 
British womanhood now became the most authentic symbol of 
British purity which had to be protected from such reviled men. In India too, as Jane Robinson showed in her book Angels of 
Albion (1996), the trust between the memsahibs and their Indian 
household staff was now forever gone.51 A whole genre of 
""mutiny novels"", studied recently by Gautam Chakravarty, 52 tried 
to reforge a British ""imperial-national identity"" that was based 
on the notion of racial and cultural superiority over the subject 
races. These novels became the site for demonstrating not only 
heroic imperial adventures, but also the impossibility of assimi­
lating the subject people. Two essays in this book offer a re­
reading of these stereotypes in the mutiny novels. Aishwarya 
Lakshmi sees in these novels a representation of India as a 
feminised domestic space tied in an uneven power relationship 
to her masculine colonial masters. Indrani Sen on the other 
hand examines how Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi has been 
portrayed in these novels, despite some notable exceptions, 
within the familiar colonial racial and gender stereotypes. What these novels sought to achieve, in other words, was to 
instil in British imagination the idea of not only military
Eighteen-Fifty-Seven and Its Many Histories 15 
supremacy but also moral superiority of the British over their 
Indian subjects. A major consequence of this imperial mythography of 1857 
was a significant shift in British policies towards India. The 
earlier reformist ideology of self-confident Victorian liberalism 
was now replaced by what Thomas Metcalf has described as the 
""conservative brand of liberalism"".53 As the Indians were inca­
pable of being reformed, they were to be governed according 
to their own tradition.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=19

pable of being reformed, they were to be governed according 
to their own tradition. This meant privileging and reinstating the 
old feudal elements - the princes and the taluqdars - who were 
now incorporated into an elaborate imperial hierarchy, at the 
top of which stood the viceroy. This also meant that the empire 
became more authoritarian. Indian tradition was redefined and 
objectified by a group of colonial ethnographers and this colonial 
knowledge represented an Indian society that was based on an 
unchanging system of beliefs, implying a society that was 
permanently divided along caste and religious fault-lines. 54 
One of the results of this was erosion of the earlier respect for 
indigenous ideas and vernacular literary traditions and learning 
in favour of blatant Anglicisation. Anu Kumar in her essay in 
this book revisits this issue by examining colonial educational 
policies before and after 1857. What she shows is that the earlier 
liberal experiments of achieving a balance between vernacular 
and English education through such institutions as the Delhi 
College or experiments such as Allan Octavian Hume's educa­
tion policies in North Western Provinces were now jettisoned in 
favour of Anglicisation, western science and vocational training. This meant a gradual decline of Persian and Arabic language 
and literature. The final demise of the Delhi court culture and 
the Mughal aristocracy after 1857, as Jon Barlow and Lakshmi 
Subramanian have drawn our attention to in their essay, also 
meant the disappearance of state patronage for the traditional 
Hindustani classical music, which was now compelled to invent 
a new identity in the colonial cities, with the patronage of a new 
modem elite. Similarly, as Lata Singh points out in her essay, the 
artistic courtesan culture of Lucknow and north India rapidly 
declined in the wake of 1857 due to colonial regulations and the 
absence of patronage, and degenerated into prostitution. What 
all these changes implied was a conservative shift in post-1857 
colonial policies. The empire became more autocratic, as

Indian sensitivities and traditions were overlooked and Indian 
aspirations for sharing power were denied. This also therefore 
made the empire more vulnerable as this frustration led to more 
articulate nationalist agitation for self-government. The events of 1857 also therefore stand as an important 
landmark in the evolution of Indian nationhood.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=20

aspirations for sharing power were denied. This also therefore 
made the empire more vulnerable as this frustration led to more 
articulate nationalist agitation for self-government. The events of 1857 also therefore stand as an important 
landmark in the evolution of Indian nationhood. In 1857 it was 
primarily religion which defined the identities of the two 
peoples - the Hindus and the Muslims 
and it was their 
religious fervour and passion which provided motivation for 
their actions. Such religiously informed sense of community had 
no place in the later day modem secular concept of nation 
nurtured by Nehru or Congress. However, Indian nationalism 
was never a monolithic structure and it is interesting to note how 
various strands of nationalism across the political spectrum, 
each looking for myths and heroes, tried to appropriate the 
history of 1857. It was of course Veer Savarkar who first 
inducted this history into the narratives of Indian nationalism by 
describing it as a ""War of Independence"" fought for 'swadhanna' 
(one's own religion) and 'swaraj' (self-rule). In this book 
Jyotirmaya Shanna has offered an interesting re-reading of this 
text. Savarkar believed in the intrinsic connection between 
swadharma and swaraj and once this connection was estab­
lished he found no problem in justifying the indiscriminate 
violence as acts of retribution to avenge the past injustices 
perpetrated on the nation. At the other end of the spectrum, 
even more secular nationalists found in 1857 their heroes as well 
as symbols of colonial injustice. When Subhas Chandra Bose 
organised his Indian National Army, the women"" s regiment was 
called the Rani of Jhansi regiment. On their march to Imphal in 
1944, at Bahadur Shah Zafar's tomb in Rangoon the soldiers of 
the INA took their solemn oath to free their motherland. ""The 
road to Delhi is the road to freedom. On to Delhi!"" - thundered 
their leader Netaji, hoping to rectify the historic injustice of 
1857.55 A little more than a year later in November 1945 the INA 
trials in Red Fort in Delhi invoked once again the memories of 
1857 and the outrageous trial of Bahadur Shah in 1858. This 
national sense of injustice resulted in an emotional outburst of 
anti-colonial riots all over India. 56 
Since then the history of 1857 has been incorporated into the 
grand narrative of Indian nationalism, as evident in the recent

Parliament. A more interesting story of its appropriation is 
however the presentist use of this history by the dalit communi­

17 
endorsement of the term ""First War of Independence"" by 
Parliament. A more interesting story of its appropriation is 
however the presentist use of this history by the dalit communi­
ties in contemporary India. Unable to reject directly the domi­
nant discourse of nationalism, they too have to seek a place 
within this grand narrative of the nation 
although the major 
hallmark of their movement in the mid-20th century was contes­
tation of this hegemonic construction of nation. Hence, in their 
search for nationalist heroines and heroes, as Charu Gupta and 
Badri Narayan show in their essays in this book, they find a 
convenient site in the fuzzy and contested history of 1857. Not 
constrained by a restrictive colonial archive, they freely invent, 
imagine and reconstruct from local oral traditions their own 
heroines and heroes - their Jhalkari Bai and Matadin Bhangi -
who not only secure for them a place in the grand narrative of 
the nation, but also implicitly subvert that narrative by revealing 
the cowardice and vulnerability of some of the celebrated 
higher caste personalities of 1857. The stories of dalit 'viranganas' also rupture the gendered 
elitist narratives of 1857 that ignored the roles of ordinary 
women. Lata Singh's essay touches on another aspect of this 
neglected history by drawing our attention to the role of 
courtesans in 1857. The courtesans of Lucknow and Kanpur -
often hidden, but mentioned nevertheless in historical docu­
ments 
participated in the popular uprising not out of any 
personal interests, but in pursuance of a political consciousness 
that naturally allied them with the rebels against the colonial 
state. Such narratives - like the one on Azizun Nisa, recently 
reconstructed in a popular play 
disrupts, as Singh argues, 
the familiar nationalist trope of ""mother India"", i e, of respect­
able women alone sacrificing their lives in the service of the 
motherland. What is interesting however is that these stories now seem to 
have received wider currency and legitimacy and have found 
place in popular films like Mangat Pandey, which Rochona 
Majumdar and Dipesh Chakrabarty have studied in this book. The story of Matadin Bhangi - the untouchable worker at the 
cartridge factory at Barrackpore who reportedly warned Mangal 
Pandey about the contaminated cartridge - finds resonance in 
the sub-plot of Nainsukh in the film.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=22

makes Mangal conscious not only of the polluting substance in the 
cartridge, but also of the real meaning of untouchability in a wider 
context of colonial power relations, and it is he who becomes the 
major instigator of civilian revolt after Mangal's hanging. There is 
also a reference in the film to a courtesan ""kotha"" and a fictional 
allusion to one such courtesan falling in love with Mangal and 
martying him the night before his execution. And when the civil 
disturbances start, she is seen in male attire participating in the 
rebellion reminding us of what Azizun Nisa reportedly did in 
Kanpur. This provides further evidence that historical films, as 
Robert Rosenstone has argued, are ""reflections of the social and 
political concerns of the era in which they are made"". 57 It is not 
unexpected that in an age of globalisation the focus of public 
attention in India would once again be on nationalism and 
internal divisions in Indian society that need to be resolved in 
the greater interest of integration and national pride. Dalit 
narratives and other potentially disruptive tropes are thus 
appropriated in the popular nationalist retelling of 1857. Majmridar and Chakrabarty have referred to the contro­
versies about the historical accuracy of this film. What we 
need to remember however is that films like Mangat Pandey 
present - to use Rosenstone's terminology again - ""history as 
drama"" as distinct from ""history as document"". For the sake of 
dramatisation there are certain trade offs in terms of data 
and accuracy. ""Film offers us history as the story of a closed, 
completed, and simple past"". It refers to a broad system of 
values; it is more certaintist, as there are no grey areas; it is 
part imagined, but not totally fictional.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=23

past for rectifying certain perceived imperfections of the 
present, in the hope of building a desirable future. The 
major advantage of film is that it is ""capable of dealing with 
the past and holding a large audience"". 58 Majumdar and 
Chakrabarty therefore argue that films like Mangal Pandey 
can bridge that hiatus between elite conception and mass 
consumption of history and thus contribute towards the 
development of a democratic culture and politics in India. We 
may add that such films also contribute towards building a 
national consciousness at a time when the invocation of an 
imagined inclusive past is essential to overcome the tensions of 
a fractured present. Eighteen-Fifty-Seven and Its Many Histories 19 
The revolt of 1857 has thus many histories - reconstructed, 
re-imagined, reinvented, remembered and memorialised in 
various ages for their manifold presentist uses. There cannot 
be any one authentic version of these events - their causes, 
their nature and their aftermath remain for ever contested. The present collection of essays draws attention to some of 
those contested issues and contributes further to those ongoing 
debates. NOTES

Situating 1857 Biswamoy Pati 
THE ""Sepoy Mutiny"" (from hereon the mutiny) - as seen by 
imperialist officials and writers initially - not only challenged 
colonialism, but also forced it to devise ways of reorienting itself 
to face a future shrouded with uncertainties and challenges. 1 
Those who focused on the ""mutiny"" theme projected it as the 
work of a set of discontented 'sipahis' who were unhappy with 
the introduction, in 1857, of the new Enfield rifle, with its distinct 
ammunition, which required the bullet to be bitten before 
loading. Rumours that the grease used on the bullets was either 
from the fat of cattle or pigs had serious implications. Thus, 
whereas cows were considered ""sacred"" by the Hindus, the 
Muslims considered pigs to be ""polluting"". This created strong 
animosities and was located as an attack on Hindu and Muslim 
religious beliefs. 2 
A HISTORIOGRAPHICAL SURVEY Contemporary official thinking was deeply affected by the 
idea of the Rebellion (hereon the rebellion) being located as a 
""Muslim conspiracy"". Syed Ahmad Khan (1817-1898) wrote a 
tract to counter this allegation, wherein he sought to examine the 
features that determined the nature of 1857 .3 Of course, contem­
porary writings generated political hysteria and racism. Some 
""eye-witness"" accounts in fact inscribed inventions such as the 
rape of white women during the mutiny4 that reinforced the 
image of the ""barbaric Indian"". Contemporary newspapers in England were condemnatory 
towards 1857. Nevertheless, there was a section of English 
opinion that supported the 1857 movement (to indicate the
26

wider notions of the events of 1857 that went beyond a 
mutiny or a rebellion and hereafter, the 1857 movement). One 
can refer to Chartists such as Ernest Jones who hailed the 
rebellion.5 The most serious dissenting voice was that of 
Karl Marx who linked the colonial exploitation of India to the 
anger that was displayed by the people during 1857.6 Moreover, 
both Marx and Engels hailed the unity displayed by the Hindus 
and Muslims who opposed British colonialism during the 
rebellion. 7 By the end of the 19th century, the rebellion attracted and 
inspired the first generation of the Indian nationalists. In fact, 
with the development oflndian nationalism, 1857 and the events 
that occurred as part of the rebellion were soon incorporated 
and appropriated as a part of nationalist imagery.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=34

VD Savarkar, who was perhaps the first Indian nationalist to 
write about 1857 in 1909, called it the ""Indian War oflndepen­
dence"". His pro-nationalist stance made Savarkar look with 
contempt and reject the British assertion that attributed the 
""war"" to the greased cartridges. As he put it, if this had been the 
issue it would be difficult to explain how it could attract Nana 
Sahib, the Mughal Emperor in Delhi, the rani of Jhansi and 
Khan Bahadur Khan to join in. Besides, Savarkar harped on the 
fact that the 1857 movement continued even after the British 
governor general issued a proclamation to withdraw the offend­
ing greased cartridges. Savarkar went ahead and connected the 
rebellion to the ""atrocities"" committed by the British.8 This 
factor of unity about 1857 - that it cut across religious bound­
aries - makes Savarkar's argument particularly striking, espe­
cially since it goes against the subsequent shift in his position 
that made him see the Hindu-Muslim divide as the most 
important component in Indian history. With the development of the working class movement in 
India, efforts were made to analyse 1857 from a Marxist position 
by M N Roy and Rajni Palme Dutt. Roy was dismissive about 
1857 and saw in its failure the shattering of the last vestiges of 
feudal power. He was emphatic about the ""revolution of 1857"" 
being a struggle between the worn-out feudal system and the 
newly introduced commercial capitalism, that sought to achieve 
political supremacy over the former.9 Palme Dutt also saw 1857 
as a major peasant revolt, even though it was led by the decaying

developments relating to the debate about the nature of 1857. What developed was a rather sophisticated nationalist historio­
graphy that emphasised the complexities of the 1857 movement. It included nationalist historians like R C Majumdar, 
S B Chaudhuri, S N Sen, and K K Datta, who were not 
uniformly comfortable with the idea that 1857 was the ""First War 
of Indian Independence"". At the same time one needs to note 
that S N Sen's work was sponsored by the state. Consequently, 
his authoritative ""official"" postcolonial account of 1857 obvi­
ously had a clear agenda - of celebrating Indian nationalism. In 
fact, the spirit of the Indian national movement influenced these 
historians. This meant that some of them referred to ideas like 
nationalism that were supposedly witnessed during the rebellion 
or saw the very inception of the national movement in the 1857 
movement. Nevertheless, they went beyond the simple 
categorisations that had seen two dominant and opposing 
narratives - one that lauded the British as the victors who had 
""won"" the war and on the other, the claims of the ""rebellious 
Indians"", who had been ""defeated"". This meant a shift in focus, with efforts being made to locate 
the internal contradictions (viz, the Indian ""rich"", which in­
cluded the moneylenders and 'buniyas') and the popular basis 
of 1857 and not concentrate merely on the influential classes that 
hitherto had been the focus of contemporary British officials, or 
statesmen like Benjamin Disraeli. It is here that nationalist 
historiography worked on and developed the legacy of the 
Marxists, even as some nationalist historians inscribed their 
disapproval of seeing it as the ""First War of Independence"". Further, the nationalist historians accorded a space - howsoever 
limited - to the popular basis of the 1857 movement.11 They 
highlighted the ""mutiny"" component of 1857 that shifted 
and soon assumed the nature of a ""civil rebellion"". Con­
sequently, nationalist historiography most certainly opened up 
new possibilities. 28

1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
NATIONALISM AND 1857 With the passage of time the development of other historical 
approaches generated a lot of debate on 1857 among historians. The first exhaustive work on the rebellion was published in 1957 
to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the event. Edited by 
PC Joshi, it focused on both the diversities and the specificities 
of the 1857 movement. 12 This included assessing 1857 against 
the colonial backdrop, examining aspects of participation and 
focusing on its internal contradictions. This volume also sought 
to highlight dimensions of popular culture by incorporating folk 
poems that have survived. In many ways, this work inspired a serious spell of writings on 
the rebellion. Scholars examined the background that condi­
tioned 1857.13 Here one can refer to Eric Stokes who wrote two 
books that focused on the revolt. His research and the sources 
used by him made him shift some of his earlier positions. 14 He 
began by articulating the elitist nature of the revolt since it had 
been led by dominant castes and communities, and attributed 
the 1857 to caste mobilisation. 15 Stokes developed his argu­
ments in his next work where he did away with his initial idea 
that had provided centrality to caste. Consequently, this work 
went beyond caste and took into account inter and intra­
regional variations while examining the nature of 1857. Interest­
ingly, Stokes went beyond strictly economic explanations and 
wove in factors like ecology, culture and mentalities. This 
implied that Stokes shifted his focus to the common people and 
moved towards forms of popular protest seen during the the 
1857 movement. In fact, the very title of this book marked a shift 
in the way Stokes located 1857 as a peasant revolt. 16 
However, it was left to historians such as Rudrangshu 
Mukherjee and Tapti Roy who took up specific area studies that 
brought to light fascinating complexities of popular militancy 
that had remained ignored thus far. 17 It was Rudrangshu 
Mukherjee who pioneered the attempt to uncover the dimension 
of popular peasant protest. 18 He examined the linkages between 
the talukdars and the peasants. While doing this, he focused on 
the leadership of the talukdars in the Awadh region and 
emphasised that the real strength of the talukdars' resistance and 
the 1857 movement was based on the general support of the 
peasantry and the people in the countryside. He explained this

Historians and Historiography: Situating 1857 29 
by referring to the agrarian relations in the region, which was 
marked by an inter-dependence of the talukdars and the peasants. He also referred to the wide scale peasant base of the revolt in 
the region. In his effort to explore the popular basis of the movement, 
where the people of Awadh fought the British, Mukherjee 
mentioned the number of ordinary and common weapons that 
were recovered, including firearms from ordinary peasants. On the basis of these sources he contested the dominant picture 
provided by ""mutiny"" literature about the nature of ""magnate 
leadership"". As Mukherjee put it, the peasants did not play a 
mere rear-guard, subaltern role. In fact, the peasants were on 
the side of the rebellion in areas where the talukdars remained 
loyal to the British. This perhaps illustrates that the rebellion 
was not always elitist in character and that in Awadh it had a 
mass, popular base. Mukherjee stressed the participation and initiatives of the 
peasantry in the rebellion which had a clear sipahi component. As explained, the sipahis were peasants in uniform. Trying to 
explain the motives of the peasants that created the basis of 
popular protest, Mukherjee mentioned the removal of the 
talukdars in the new system of agrarian settlements imposed by 
the British and the problems posed by the new revenue demands, 
which caused insecurities and anxieties. These were reinforced 
by the removal of the nawab (Wajid Ali Shah) and the range of 
fears about religion and caste, together with the imposition of 
British rule that created fears and anger among the entire agrarian 
population. It led to apprehensions about the collapse of the 
traditional order of inter-dependence between the ruler and the 
peasants and issues related to the moral economy of the 
peasant. However, as clarified, the link with the talukdar did not 
impose a subordinate position for the peasants, who actually 
played a decisive influence on many occasions. In fact, whereas 
the talukdars could and did manage to get pardoned, the sipahis 
and the peasants who rebelled faced the certain risk of being 
""massacred"" in case they surrendered. These features deter­

impose a subordinate position for the peasants, who actually 
played a decisive influence on many occasions. In fact, whereas 
the talukdars could and did manage to get pardoned, the sipahis

1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
Tapti Roy explored the popular world of the countryside in 
the Bundelkhand region and its relationship with the 1857 
rebellion. 19 Thus, the rebellion began by targeting government 
officials, bankers and mahajans and the burning of official 
papers and the ""'plundering' of neighbouring towns. As 
emphasised, these symbolised some kind of a selective targeting 
and the driving out of all visible forms of British power with 
which the peasants had interacted. As argued, these reflected 
the more negative forms of political assertion which marked the 
most obvious and widespread form of rural 'jacqueries'.20 This 
perhaps accounted for the involvement of a large number of 
people, sometimes as many as three to four thousand men of 
different areas (viz, Johurpur, Bainda, Simree and Wasilpur) 
who had assembled at Tindwaree on. June 11, 1857. Roy located a shift after the initial phase of the rebellion in 
Bundelkhand. Thus, after the anger of the common people was 
directed against those associated with the colonial power, it 
moved against those they identified with the internal order of 
exploitation. This included the auction-purchasers, decree­
holders, merchants and bankers. These were the people who 
were responsible for the disruption and the disorder that set in 
with the advent of colonialism that affected the common 
people.21 As mentioned, after taking over the urban centres the 
sipahis began their ""attacks"" on the affluent people. After they 
left, people from the countryside continued to be involved with 
this trend, on occasions along with the zamindars. Roy located 
this as a symbolic way of displaying power by challenging the 
contested order. While mentioning the intensity of the counter-insurgency 
operations, Roy wove in the large-scale desertions of people 
from their villages in an attempt to explain the intensity of 
popular participation. Besides, she highlighted the way the 
zamindars and peasants set up their own zones and made some 
rebel leaders, including some from outside their areas, head 
them. She emphasised the unity between the peasants and the 
landed sections against the British who were seen as the com­
mon enemy and some sections associated with colonialism.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=39

among other things, the level of mass participation. She

illustrated this aspect by highlighting the participation of the 
low castes and the marginal people. Roy explained the high 
level of solidarity and mass participation by referring to the 
marginality of agricultural production in the Bundelkhand 
region which actually worked as a leveller among the different 
sections in the village. This posed acute problems and united 
the peasants and the landlords who faced impoverishment. It 
was this factor that united diverse sections in the countryside 
and both shaped and expressed rural dissent. MULTIPLE NARRATIVES OF 1857 Over the years historians have also examined other facets of 
1857. These relate to the organisation,22 middle level leader­
ship,23 activities in the areas where British authority had been 
subverted and if it was indeed a restorative rebellion. 24 More 
recently - since the 1990s - historians have focused on the 
popular dimensions of 1857, including the specificities of the 
involvement of adivasis, 25 low castes and outcastes, 26 popular 
culture27 and questions related to the alternative order that 
emerged. 28 Moreover, scholars working within the paradigms of 
cultural studies have sought to delineate the way racism emerged 
as a virtual fall-out of the rebellion. By weaving in the theme of 
the ""rape"" of white women during the rebellion, they have 
focused on the barbaric image of the natives in south Asia.29 Of course, Rajat Ray's new work explores the popular 
mentalities of the 1857 rebellion and offers fascinating clues to 
grasp both its spirit and its collective cosmology. 30 As emphasised,

Muslims jointly asserting their respective religious creeds and 
not in terms of a nation asserting its independence from colonial 
rule. This was based in patriotism that was rooted in a sponta­
neous desire for independence from alien rule. Ray connected 
this to the people selecting and setting up their kings in some of
32 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
the storm-centres of the rebellion. This assumed significance in 
a context wherein the restored chiefs had to accept the position 
of the sipahi councils which epitomised peoples' power. Ray described the alternative order that emerged as one that 
was curiously republican-democratic and which co-existed with 
a hierarchical, princely structure. After all, as has been pointed 
out, the restored feudal chiefships of 1857 were very unlike the 
old regimes of the 18th century since 1857 had a mass movement 
behind it. In terms of collective mentality, 1857 marked a ""race 
war"" against the white oppressors, who formed the master race. Nevertheless, ideologically this was projected as a struggle 
between the true religions (viz, Hinduism and Islam) and the 
false one (viz, Christianity). This did not result due to the efforts 
to impose the false doctrine of the ""trinity"". Instead, it was 
related to the question of identity of the ""Hindus and Muslims 
of Hindustan"" which was threatened by the moral and material 
aggrandisement of the arrogant imperial power. These features 
provided the dynamism that gave a new meaning to the rein­
stated chiefs of the 18th century. Ray underlined the peculiarity of 1857. Thus, it was a war of 
races, without being a race war, since the subject race conceived 
it as a war of religion. It was a religious war that really cannot 
be located in this way, since the rebellion was not directed at the 
religion of the master race, but its political domination. It was 
a patriotic war of Hindu-Muslim brotherhood, which he called 
the ""inchoate social nationality"" of Hindustan, but was not a 
national war. Conceptually, it was rooted in the past, but groped 
for an alternative to the technologically advanced British rule. In this sense it was not traditional, but was neither modern.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=41

movement nor can it be seen as the dying ""throes of the old 
order"". As argued by Ray, the 1857 movement was a patriotic war of 
the people who expressed their sense of national identity 
through the brotherhood of the two principal religions of a 
common land. Ideologically it reflected a foetal national com­
munity that was opposed to the civil society, which had outposts 
in the enclaves of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. Factors of

racial subjugation created a sense of oneness that was, however, 
untainted by ideas of national sovereignty. The 1857 rebellion 
could express itself only through the political vocabulary of 
restoration that the people were accustomed to. It was marked 
by a disjunction from the past in the way people's power 
expressed itself through the sipahi councils. Consequently, even 
while the rebellion failed to generate a new order it was 
unrecognisable to the prevailing tradition itself. The white man 
- and not the rebellion - had turned the world upside down. What was attempted during the rebellion was to turn the world 
back. However, as articulated by Ray, since the old order had 
been transformed it could never be restored. SOME CONCLUSIONS As can be seen, the 1857 rebellion was the first anti-colonial 
mass movement directed against the aggression of imperialist 
policies demonstrated in course of the first-half of the 19th 
century. It was the first major armed movement faced by the 
British in India. It was a political struggle and not based only on 
what can be narrowly defined as ""economic"" factors. Besides 
shaking the foundations of colonial rule in large parts of 
northern India, its political fall-out was felt elsewhere, in the 
sense that it stirred up anti-colonial imagination. Some nationalist historians like S B Chaudhuri argue that 
1857 had two distinct strands - the military rising and the mass 
rebellion.:11 The problem is that this position does not view

sustain it, if the background of 1857, that is, the popular 
movements seen against colonialism, is kept in mind. Besides, it needs to be stressed that the sipahi provided the 
crucial link between these two components, given his close 
proximity both to the peasantry and the countryside. This issue 
can be resolved in a serious manner in case more research is 
directed towards local studies that explore popular participa­
tion and protest. A point that needs some elaboration is the emphasis given to the 
religious angle and the so-called ""clash of cultures"" during the 
rebellion. Strangely enough, echoes of this are heard even today 
that un-historically connect 1857 - where we encounter references
34 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekfy 
to terms such as 'jehad', 'jehadis', etc - to September 11, 2001 
(more popularly called 9/11 ).32 lt is perhaps here that one needs 
to examine the role of the W ahabis, who have been located 
mono-dimensionally as opponents of the British.33 In fact, in a 
recent unpublished paper lqtidar Alam Khan has shown that 
many of the people clubbed together as Wahabis included 
Sufis. Secondly, he has demonstrated the complexities involved 
in the interactions between the Wahabis and the British over the 
first-half of the 19th century, which oscillated between collabo­
ration and confrontation and was not based on opposition 
alone. Finally, Khan shows how the meaning of jehad 
viz, 
""religious war"" - has been misunderstood, since in the context 
of the rebellion it meant a ""just war"" against imperialism, which 
included non-Muslims. 34 
Talking of popular participation, historians like Ranajit Guha 
argue that peasants remained confined to their local bound­
aries. 35 As discussed, Tapti Roy's work contradicts this asser­
tion. As demonstrated by her, the peasants not only moved to 
urban centres but also welcomed rebels from outside their 
immediate areas as their leaders. This feature is also applicable 
to the adivasi tracts and, in fact, K S Singh has referred to the 
unity of the tribals and non-tribals. We have seen how the basic thrust of the 1857 movement was 
directed against the colonial regime and the sections that 
emerged after its entry into northern India.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=43

against the planters and colonial officials, but also the buniyas 
and moneylenders who represented the internal order of exploi­
tation. Moreover, one needs to bear in mind the world of the 
adivasis that had a history of major movements prior to 1857. Besides, there is a need to unveil the problems related to the ill­
treatment and sexual exploitation of adivasi women, which seem 
to have links with some of these rebellions. 36 Similarly, the over­
emphasis on sipahis like Mangal Pandey veils the role of the 
outcastes and low castes in the cantonments as well as outside. Very recently a spell of research has been undertaken to 
focus on hitherto untouched dimensions under the aegis of the 
Indian History Congress. 37 For example, it has been shown that 
the colonial remained terrified of the Mughals - even after 
Bahadur Shah Zafar who was exiled to Rangoon till as late as 
the 1880s. As a result, the colonial government feared that their

continued presence in north India would serve in delegitimising 
colonial rule and lead to the rise of anti-colonial sentiments. 38 
Scholars have also tapped Urdu newspapers that tell us about 
1857. 39 Similarly, historians have worked on ""mutiny narratives"" 
of white women to weave in the way the event was located by 
the white women. 40 Taken together, all these efforts would 
enable us to bring to light some relatively unknown facets of the 
1857 rebellion. SPECIAL ISSUE This special issue on 1857 presents to the reader the diverse

Hindu nationalism. Thus, Peter Robb's 'A Brief History of an

from Europe in 1848 to the Taiping and the Nien movements 
(both in China) after 1858 in the ex-colonial world, pointing to 
their failure as a common element. As Robb argues, the Indian 
uprising mattered greatly because British rule was restored, but 
would have mattered much more if the British had been thrown 
out of India. Robb's contribution emphasises the way 1857 had 
an impact on the mind more than on the ""material world"", and 
in this sense directs our attention to an area that is normally 
ignored. Michael H Fisher's 'The Multiple Meanings of 1857 for 
Indians in Britain', points to the diversities as well as the shifts 
associated with 1857 that had an influence on the way in which 
Indians within British society related themselves to 1857. At the 
same time, Fischer notes certain specificites that involved shifts 
and changes in the attitudes of British women towards Indians 
over the 1850s, during the rebellion and after it ended. Anu Kumar's 'New Lamps for Old: Colonial Experiments 
with Vernacular Education, pre and post 1857', focuses on the
36

vital subject of colonial educational policy. Kumar delineates 
some of the issues and experiments associated with the 
colonial educational interventions prior to 1857. As elaborated, 
the imprints of 1857 left their mark on this sector, which was 
decisively affected by it. Jyotirmaya Sharma's, 'History as Revenge and Retaliation: 
Re-reading Savarkar's The War of Independence of 1857', while 
analysing Savarkar's position on the Rebellion, highlights the 
importance of looking at the range of his writings and his world 
view holistically. For Savarkar the most important aspect invol­
ved having an ""enemy"". In this sense, his work is charged with 
aggressive Hindu nationalism. As Sharma puts it, the celebratory 
descriptions of the massacres of the British in India introduced 
a new vocabulary into Indian politics. In fact, we can perhaps

""future"" fate of the Muslims, clearly ""otherised"" by him.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=45

aspects of technology and war, including the ""sepoy"" compo­
nent, during 1857. Kaushik Roy's '1857: The Beginning of 
People's War in India', examines aspects related to warfare. According to Roy, this underwent a shift from the ""limited war"" 
of the 18th century to what he calls a ""people's war"" by the mid-
19th century. The European wars of the 18th century were of 
limited liability and fought without any moral or ideological 
issues. European warfare in the 18th century comprised conflicts 
between the armies raised, equipped and fed by bureaucratised 
monarchies. While waging warfare, such armies made clear 
distinctions between the armed forces and the civilians. How­
ever, Roy argues these ""were wiped away"" in the era of the 
people's war from the mid-19th century. Conducted by the 
people's armies, citizens became soldiers and the home front was 
also mobilised to support the war effort. Consequently, the 
watertight compartmentalisation between the home front and the 
battlefront ""vanished"". Public opinion was an important compo­
nent that shaped the conduct of such wars. As Roy feels, the 
1857 rebellion contained in it the elements that can be charac­
teristic of a ""people's war"". The English East India Company's 
(hereafter EEIC) wars with the indigenous powers between 1770 
and 1849 were similar to the European 18th century wars. Kaushik Roy sees a shift in the nature of the combat during
Historians and Historiography: Situating 1857 37 
1857, with a lethal increase in the scope, intensity and impact on 
society, with both sides aiming to eliminate the enemy. Sabyasachi Dasgupta's 'The Rebel Army in 1857: Vanguard 
of the War of Independence or a Tyranny of Arms', argues that 
the mutiny by the sepoys was an act of repudiation against the 
EEIC and also the traditional ruling class of India. It was an 
assertion of autonomous power, a force which threatened to 
sweep away the symbols of colonial power in northern India. It 
also threatened to alter the traditional power equations in 
indigenous society. The nature of the outbreak and the rapidly 
evolving political dynamics during the course of the mutiny 
represented a severe threat to established hierarchies in indig­
enous society. The sepoys sought to rapidly carve out an 
autonomous space for themselves within the power hierarchy.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=46

with people's power. The autonomy of the sepoys did not 
represent the autonomy of the people. Despite their strong links 
with peasant society, the sepoys possessed a distinct identity and 
considered themselves to be distinct from indigenous society. Company service which they violently repudiated in 1857 gave 
them a sense of empowerment. In such a context, they aspired 
to be the new elite and were ready to take on the old elite and 
the common peasantry. Dasgupta's effort takes into account the 
Bengal sepoy. Though from high castes, they came from a 
middle farmer background and hardly belonged to the elite of 
indigenous society. Then we have three contributions that direct our attentiofl. towards the fascinating possibilities that exist in the ""margins"" 
that are beginning to attract the attention of social historians 
negotiating 1857. Three essays take us into the world of the 
adivasi women, dalits and dalit women. Shashank S Sinha, 'In 
Search of Alternative Histories of 1857: Witch-hunts, Adivasis, 
and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur' (published in the 'Commen­
tary' section of this issue), focuses on a predominantly tribal 
tract, outside the mainstream belt that was shaken by 1857. Sinha explores the gender angle that has hardly attracted any 
historian. His exploration draws upon women who were in­
volved in the uprising more as victims than as active partici­
pants. Working on a canvas of social history he investigates the 
""occasioning of perhaps the first mass witch-hunts"" among tribal
38 1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
communities of Singhbhum and the Santhal parganas. As 
argued, these witch-hunts formed a conscious contour of 
resistance that reflect gender and also anti-colonial tensions in 
the Chhotanagpur tract. Badri Narayan's 'Reactivating the Past: Dalits and Memories 
of 1857', explores a relatively new dimension by focusing on the 
way the dalit communities in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh relate to 
and identify with the 1857 movement. Their perceptions are 
reflected in the contemporary representation of their desires, 
aspirations and identity. As Narayan puts it, for these com­
munities, the histories and heroes associated with 1857 is not 
merely an issue of academic interest but is also an intimate part 
of their everyday life in the form of memories of their heroes and 
deities they worship.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=47

the freedom fighters of 1857 and are inspired by them in their 
daily struggle against continued social, economic and political 
exclusion and discrimination. Charu Gupta's 'Dalit Virangas and the Re-invention of 1857', 
examines the representations of 1857 revolt in contemporary 
popular Hindi dalit literature of north India, focusing on the 
portrayal of dalit heroic women in it. This literature represents the 
historical consciousness of 1857 in the public memory of the dalits, 
with the focus no longer on the sepoys or the greased cartridges, 
but on dalits groaning under foreign oppression. These popular 
histories are littered with dalit female heroic icons some con­
structed, some exaggerated, some discovered - who have become 
the symbols of bravery for particular dalit castes and ultimately 
for all dalits. Thus, they symbolise counter-histories of 1857. Through these, Gupta interrogates both conventional and 
historical writings on 1857 and mainstream portrayals of dalit 
women and dalit writings on the subject. She examines ways in 
which contemporary popular Hindi dalit literature of north 
India has dealt with the role of dalits in the freedom struggles of 
the colonial period, particularly the revolt of 1857. Alongside, 
she focuses on the role and representation of dalit women in it. Gupta interrogates both conventional and historical writings on 
1857 as well as mainstream portrayals of dalit women and dalit 
writings on the subject. Finally we have a set of papers that look into the world of 
cultural representations. These range from examining ""mutiny

illustrate that this domestic body of the empire was gendered 
and deterministic. While noting the shifts and changes from the 
earlier period, she emphasises the re-alignment and re-reading 
of the late 19th century ""adventure novel"" within the post­
mutiny domestic ideology and figuration of the empire. Indrani Sen's 'Inscribing the Rani of Jhansi in Colonial 
'Mutiny' Fiction' studies the construction of the Rani of Jhansi 
in four colonial novels written between the 1870s and 1900s, 
which touch upon the subject of the rani and the theme of the 
Rebellion of 1857. She probes the diversities of representations 
and the shifts in these fictional works, varying from licentious to 
heroic projections. As argued by Sen, the strategic importance 
of this literary genre and its enormous popularity can be traced 
to post-'Mutiny' insecurities and anxieties and the need to 
present epic narratives of British heroics and the solidarity of 
colonisers. Swarupa Gupta's '1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in 
Bengal: Nuances and Themes', points to the uniqueness of the 
Bengali (regional) representation of an iconic ""national"" event. As emphasised, in the grounding of nationhood, the location of 
1857 in history was crucial. Gupta argues that the urge for 
progress emphasised the inculcation of a ""proper"" code of 
conduct and self-improvement, which found expression in 
cultural nationalism and the agenda of 'jatipratishtha'. Thus the 
national element in the literati's discourse was couched in a 
'samajik' and not a religious rhetoric. The utopic and inclusive 
space of the continually-incorporating 'samaj' moved beyond 
Hindustan toward a 'Bharatbarsha', transcending and 
marginalising the localised nature of the revolt. Though 
there were inherent limitations (such as contextual dilution of

and 1857 Revolt' (also published in the 'Commentary' section of 
this issue) brings to life the performing community of courtesans. As she argues, they acquire in their ordinariness and everyday­
ness a stereotypical image. Thus 'tawaif, the term used for the 
courtesan has value-loaded connotations and is often equated to 
a whore, marginalising these women performers into silence. When they did speak, they had to reinvent themselves through 
polite myths to reinforce their self-esteem. By negotiating the 
courtesan through a play Azizun Nisa San Sattavan Ka Kissa 
('A courtesan and 1857 Revolt') written by the present-day 
playwright Tripurari Sharma, Singh touches upon a dimension 
that has been left untouched by social historians and feminist 
scholars. Sharma's play attempts to rewrite dominant versions 
of historical truth and relocate and establish the ""loose"" subjects 
of colonial history to their rightful roles in the anti-colonial 
struggles too. As Singh puts it, what makes the play particularly 
significant is not just retrieving the courtesans who were denied 
agency or a presence by the colonialist project of mis-represen­
tations, but also to bring them back into the creative domain. And Rochona Majumdar and Dipesh Chakrabarty's paper, 
'Mangal Pandey: Film and History', engages in a theoretical 
discussion weaving in reel life and history. It explores the 
diversities and pluralities associated with a post-colonial 
'reading' of the film Mangat Pandey: The Rising. NOTES

where it assumes respectable forms, to the colonies, where it goes naked. Did they not, in India, to borrow an expression of that great robber, Lord 
Clive himself, resort to atrocious extortion, when simple corruption could 
not keep pace with their rapacity? While they prated in Europe about the

Remembering 1857 
An Introductory Note 
Dipesh Chakrabarty 
THE 150th anniversary of 1857 is being celebrated in many parts 
of India. That is one kind of remembering of the historical 
rebellion. Anniversaries ring of calendars set to different scales, 
from the national and the regional to the personal. Calendars 
mean order, some ordering of national or personal time. There 
must be an element of unintended historical irony about the 
process by which popular rebellions or insurgencies - the 
quintessential politics of which is to challenge an oppressive 
order by collective gestures of defiance, a phenomenon that 
Ranajit Guha once called ""negation"" - become domesticated 
festive dates on a national calendar and cease to act, or so at least 
the makers of the calendar hope, as an incitement to further 
rebellion. 1 This short introductory essay is built around the 
tension between these two kinds of recall of the original event: 
as a recurring, ceremonial date in the life of the nation and as a 
perpetual incitement to future rebellion. What is the politics of remembering 1857? To facilitate 
discussion, I shall begin by distinguishing between three kinds 
of practices involved in the work of memory. I do not claim that 
these three practices exhaust the complex phenomenon of 
memory. These are simply the practices that usually come under 
the purview of the social sciences, while there remain many 
other aspects to memory - such that scientists study - but social 
scientists are not trained to speak of them. The three functions 
I have in mind are {a) memorialising, (b) memorising, and 
{ c) remembering/forgetting. Both memorialising and memorising 
have to do with representations of the past. The third function 
- that of remembering/forgetting - takes us beyond the politics

of representation. To speak in terms that thinkers such as 
Roman Jakobson or Roland Barthes once made available, it 
could be said that the relation between memorialising and 
memorising is somewhat akin to that between metaphor and 
metonymy, while the third function, remembering/forgetting, 
takes memory-work beyond that of representation. Let me begin 
by explaining my terms, one by one.2

MEMORY AND THE QUESTION OF FORGETTING 1857 There is one kind of memory of 1857 that is perhaps now

MEMORY AND THE QUESTION OF FORGETTING 1857 There is one kind of memory of 1857 that is perhaps now 
irretrievably lost. This is the past as personal grief: memory that 
would have expressed itself at the time in numerous acts of 
personal grieving, in families' and kin-groups' sense of loss and 
bereavement, both on the British side and on the Indian. Think, 
for example, of the 250 rebels hanged or some blown to pieces 
at the mouth of guns near Peshawar by the orders of Colonel 
John Nicholson in May 1857 or the British prisoners put to death 
the following month in Jhansi by the rebels, details of which 
incidents are here reported in this special issue by Kaushik Roy. How much do we know about the history of the pain that their 
relatives would have suffered and about the expression and 
duration of such pain? Precious little. Not simply because we 
have no documents, though there is no denying that documents, 
if they had existed, would have helped us to produce accounts 
of such painful memory. The more important reason, it seems 
to me, why our memory-practices to do with deeply personal 
sense of loss challenge historical representation is because these 
practices speak often to a level existence that is better captured 
by phenomenological thinking than by the kind of paper-trail 
that the historian routinely chases. The Italian author Alessandro Portelli's remarkable book, 
The Order Has Been Carried Out, gives some examples that might 
help us to think through the problem. 3Portelli's book is a study 
(mostly) of the wives and children of 335 unarmed and innocent 
civilians who were mercilessly gunned down by Nazi occupation 
forces in Rome on March 24, 1944 in retaliation for a partisan 
attack on some Nazi personnel the day before. He gives several 
examples of expression of grief where the expression is built into

everyday practices, leaving no traces for the future historian. ""We asked my grandmother"", says one of Portelli's interviewees, 
""no questions about this story [to do with the interviewee's uncle 
killed in the massacre], as we knew it was almost a taboo subject 
that you couldn't touch. I remember that she had this golden 
brooch with my uncle's picture, she always kept it pinned to her 
suit, so the pain of this story is something that was passed

through to us, too."" Yet this transmission of pain was conditional 
on what was described here as ""a great deal of restraint"". 4 Or 
there was this case of another mother whose grief was expressed 
life-long through her physical orientation to the world at times 
of holidays: Most of the time [she] tried to deny it, and so she thought he was 
abroad, she thought he was away. She knew, but she had developed 
this neurotic denial of death - my grandfather wrote about it in some 
poems - where on holidays she would set the table for him, and when 
the season changed she would bring out his winter or his summer 
clothes; so that this agony was revived for those who had come to terms 
with the problem of this death.5 Portelli's material comes from interviews. But in either ex­
ample, we are dealing with expressions of grief, culturally 
specific in their particularities no doubt, that would have left no 
evidence on paper. Coming back to 1857, who knows how the 
bereft grieved and for how long. This later forgetting of grief of 
the survivors of the event belongs to the memory function that 
challenges the very question of representation. Without repre­
sentation at a primary level, there is no second or third-order 
representation that we usually call history. If grief presents us thus with a lost object of representation, 
there exists, it would seem, a critical relation between this lost 
object and the object whose representation founds the nation. Take Rabindranath Tagore's great novel Gora, serialised first in

59,"Take Rabindranath Tagore's great novel Gora, serialised first in 
the Bengali magazine Prabasi between the years 1907 and 1909. The novel is set in Calcutta in the 1880s. Gora, the central 
character of the novel, is a child brought up by Hindu-Bengali 
foster-parents. In his 20s, he becomes a convert to the stridently 
Hindu nationalism that was sweeping across Bengal at the time. It is only towards the end of the novel, faced with a dying father

the father die, that he discovers suddenly his biological identity: 
he was not born a Hindu. He was born of Irish parents during 
the tumultuous events of 1857. Krishnadayal, his foster-father 
says to him: ""It was during the Mutiny. We were in Etawa then. Your mother fled from the sipahis and sought refuge one night 
in our house. Your father was killed in the previous day's 
fighting .... He was an Irishman. That very night your mother 
died after giving birth to you. Ever since then you have been 
brought up in our house. "" 6Krishnadayal offered to tell Gora the 
name of his biological father: ""His name was -"". Gora stopped 
him midway through the sentence: ""His name is not necessary. I don't need to know his name. ""7 As is well known, it was on this deliberate refusal on Gora's 
part to know the lost object of his grief 
on this void - that 
Tagore outlined the condition that made it possible for Gora to 
be both expansively and inclusively Indian. ""Today"", says Gora 
in the last chapter of the novel, ""I am Bharatiya. Within me there 
is no conflict between communities, whether Hindu or Muslim 
or Khrishtan. Today all the castes of Bharat are my caste, 
whatever everybody eats is my food."" And he continues in this 
vein: ""I have taken birth this morning, with an utterly naked 
consciousness, in my own Bharatvarsha . ... Teach me the mantra 
of that deity who belongs to all Hindu, Musalman, Khrishtan, 
Brahmo - the doors of whose temple are never closed to any 
person... the deity not only of Hindus but of Bharatvarsha. ""8 It was as if only by making the grief of the Irish family (including 
his own) unavailable to any order of signs that Gora could bring 
his identity as Indian within the sphere of representation. My conclusion, then, is: we have no memories of 1857. There 
were no doubt such memories once but they died without heirs. Andrew Ward tells the story of William Jonah Shepherd, a

said, representation. Insofar as 1857 is concerned, all we have, 
it seems to me, is the politics of memorialising and memorising 
the event, that is to say, the politics, indeed, of representation, 
of metaphorical and metonymic use of the composite name 
""1857"". THE METAPHORIC FUNCTION OF MEMORIALISING Memorialising has to do with the creation of memorials, 
temporary or permanent. But memorials, as mere objects, 
cannot perform the function of memorialising. Memorialising 
happens when particular objects associated with someone or 
some event we want to remember, are put in a relationship to 
certain practices to create rituals of remembering. Such rituals 
are usually collective in nature. A good example is the modem 
story of Shivaji's memorial in Raigad, Maharashtra. Once 
erected in the memory of the king who gave the Mughals many 
sleepless nights, it had fallen into utter disrepair by the 19th 
century with a jungle growing up around it. It was a European 
writer,James Douglas, the author of Book of Bombay (1883), who 
first drew attention to its dilapidated condition and upbraided 
nationalists in Maharashtra for neglecting the memory of 
Chhatrapati Shivaji. It was then that Ranade, Tilak, and a 
host of others moved in the 1880s to petition the government to 
sanction money for its repair and later created special national­
ists rituals around the 'samadhi'. 10 By itself, then, the samadhi 
performed no memorialising function. It was only through a 
combination of its own materiality and (nationalist) ritual acti­
vities associated with it that the samadhi resumed its status as a 
memorial.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=60

of the Residency building in Lucknow, the Memorial Well at 
Kanpur, Felice Beato's photographs, William Simpson's 
watercolours, to archival documents that scholars have pored 
over to produce historical narratives of ""the mutiny"". These 
relics can become memorials depending on what use we put 
them to. And, sometimes, they have indeed performed as 
memorials. As Narayani Gupta writes: In the years after 1858, visitors to north India would reverently relive 
the episodes (of 1857) by pacing them out on the ground, aided by
50

detailed maps and copious albums of photographs. As the sites 
became pilgrim-destinations the concept of ""monument"" used for 
historic architecture widened to include sacred landscapes like the 
Ridge at Delhi and memorials to those who had died in 1857-58. Historic buildings like the Delhi fort were invested with new interest 
through their connection with the events of the revolt. 11 
What is at issue is the critical role of practices in making 
memorialising possible. Photographs, maps, stories, coupled 
with the practice of travel or pilgrimage, could be part of a 
memorialising complex. Books or even films, as Rochona 
Majumdar and I have tried to suggest in our essay in this issue, 
can be grist to the mill of memorialising. Surely, the official 
history of 1857, 7857, written by Surendranath Sen, was issued 
by the government oflndia to memorialise the momentous year. Publishing a book to mark the national calendar, creating a 
readership through journals, seminars and conferences, was 
indeed to memorialise. The first step towards memorialising, it seems to me, is to 
create out of a set of events a second or higher-order represen­
tation. This is what I have called the metaphoric aspect of

attempt to make the events of 1857 stand for a larger, coherent 
theme is to create a metaphor out of these events: i e, to make 
these events represent something beyond their immediacy. This 
is where this present issue, at one level a memorialising enter­
prise marking the 150th anniversary of 1857, also takes a critical 
stance on anniversaries. For many of the essays collected here 
critically engage the metaphoric function that gives an anniver­
sary its representational drive. Peter Robb questions many of the 
larger metaphors that have subtended scholarly and amateur 
interest in the subject: the ""myth"" of an ""Indian revolt"" and 
colonial arguments that made 1857 into a ground for debating 
""the nature of India and the way it should be ruled"". Sabyasach: 
Dasgupta similarly questions the tendency to look on 1857 as a 
""people's revolt"" though Kaushik Roy makes the events of 
rebellion an instance of the idea of ""people's war"" that he sees 
as part of an emergent global history in the middle of the 19th 
century. Aishwarya Lakshmi and Swarupa Gupta both delineate 
and critique colonial and Bengali-nationalist attempts,
Remembering 7857: An Introductory Note 51 
respectively, to render 1857 intelligible by producing out of it 
larger narratives about the feminised landscape of India (want­
ing to be colonised) or a space for ""reconfiguring the nation"". Barlow and Subramaniam's detailed discussion of the career of 
north Indian music and Anu Kumar's essay on the Delhi 
College before and after 1857, both ask if 1857 was indeed the 
fulcrum around which turned the meta-narrative of transition to 
""modernisation"" of music and education under British rule. Fisher's essay brings into view a global aspect to the history of 
1857 by focusing on Indians in Britain. Here, again, 1857 is both 
staged and queried as a turning-point in the larger narrative of 
race relations in the empire. It is the conversion of an event into a metaphor of relevance 
to public life that makes for a degree of competition in the public 
sphere as to which event should be memorialised, that is to say, 
which event could act as the best bearer of a chosen metaphor.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=62

language of equal or proportional representation. In his afore­
mentioned book, Portelli cites an interviewee who resented the 
attention that the monument at the Fosse Ardeatine received in 
the commemoration of the Nazi massacre of 1944. He has an 
interviewee called Nicoletta Leoni say: It isn't right that in Rome we should talk only of the Fosse Ardeatine. We should talk also of Forte Bravetta, we should talk of La Storta, we 
should talk of people killed in the streets. My grandfather had been 
sentenced to death, he might have died at Forte Bravetta; now, if he had 
died at Forte Bravetta, how would I feel when all that people talk about 
is the Ardeatine? But the media, if you tell them about Forte Bravetta, 
they don't care. Do you know why the Ardeatine are so important? Because the monument is there. 12 
Echoing as it were the questions posed by Leoni, Sabyasachi 
Dasgupta asks in this issue, ""Why do we celebrate the revolt (of 
1857) as the first war of independence? Why should not we 
celebrate say the santhal and the Moplah uprisings or for that 
matter countless other uprisings? Why are their 150th anniver­
saries not commemorated?"" The same contestatory spirit is 
documented in the contributions, say, of Charu Gupta, Badri 
Narayan, Shashank Sinha, and in Lata Singh's essay on ""Cour­
tesans and the 1857 Revolt"". All of these essays ask versions of 
Nicoletta Leoni's questions. They seek to represent the hitherto

and Narayan, by their use of ballads and songs, also point to a 
domain of popular, anti-elite history and alternative practices of 
celebrations and claims to the nation that challenge the official 
narrative of Indian nationalism. In both cases, what is fascinat­
ing is the absorption into the language of electoral politics in 
north India - by Mayawati, by the Bahujan Samaj Party and 
other agencies - of dalit heroes and the tales about their valour 
relating to the battles of 1857. Memorialising, one may then say, has a public character and 
seizes upon a historical moment to produce metaphors for 
public life. It is, however, at the same time open to all the 
contestations of public life as well. And this collection of essays 
bears ample and rich testimony to this contestation. MEMORISING 1857: THE METONYMIC FUNCTION By ""memorising"", I refer to acts of remembering that work 
through certain short-hand devices that could be, in a manner 
of speaking, compared to mnemonics. However, my use of the 
term ""memorising"", which owes much to the classic studies of 
Frances Yates and Paul Ricoeur, is also different from theirs. 13 
So I need to explain a little. Readers of Ricoeur will find my 
juxtaposition of ""memorising"" and ""remembering"" in the first 
sentence of this paragraph strange because Ricoeur clearly sees 
the two terms, with good reason, as opposed in meaning. We 
remember things that have happened before. ""The temporal 
mark of the before thus constitutes the distinctive mark 
of remembering"", writes Ricoeur .14 Memorising, something that 
Yates, drawing on her sources, calls ""artificial memory,"" relates 
to what we deliberately use as a learning strategy for mastering 
something unfamiliar (such as a foreign language). 15 
So why do I use ""memorising"" with respect to 1857? Why do 
I use ""remembering"" and ""memorising"" in the same sentence? It seems to me that 1857 produced much panic on the European
Remembering 1857: An Introductory Note 53 
side (shared by many non-combatant Indians as well).",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=64

side (shared by many non-combatant Indians as well). Its 
counterpart on the side of the rebels would be fear, the fear that 
British revenge wanted to instil in them. It is hard to find a 
continuous account of what this panic, or its memory, did to the 
colonial officialdom in the years following 1857. We have some 
indirect pieces of evidence close to hand. Writing on the 
occasion of the centenary of 1857, the communist leader and 
writer P CJ oshi recalled that when Keir Hardie came to India 
in 1907, ""the year of the 50th anniversary of the 1857 uprising"", 
Hardie noted ""in what jitters the British administration were"", 
Joshi also cited Edward Thompson who, in 1925, wrote of ""the 
Mutiny"" as an ""unavenged and unappeased ghost"" that flitted 
""right at the back of the mind of many an Indian ... as he talks 
with an Englishman"".16 Thompson's statement may have had a 
measure of truth; but he was also probably looking into a mirror. Statements such as his and Hardie's point to a long after|life of 
the events of 1857 in the minds of the British in India. At the same time, it is clear that for historians on the Left, too, 
irrespective of debates about whether or not 1857 was a ""popu­
lar revolt"", the rising has, for quite some time, meant a general 
figure of insurgency in the countryside that was to presage 
political developments in the 20th century. Max Harcourt, who 
in the 1970s studied peasant rebellions in Bihar and eastern UP 
during the Quit India (1942) movement, was struck by the 
similarity between the violent events of that movement and 
those of 1857. ""The pattern of unrest"", he writes, ""was very 
reminiscent of the rural disturbances accompanying the 1857 
Mutiny"", the only difference being that the peasantry, disarmed 
after 1857, had no weapons to match those of the British.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=65

Guha's classic book on peasant insurgency in 19th century India 
- that sought to distil out of 1857 and other risings a general 
paradigm for peasant insurgency in this period - saw the same 
logic of insurrection at work in the anti-vasectomy campaign of 
the mid-1970s in north India: "" ... one has merely to refer to some 
of the anti-'nasbandi' disturbances in rural Haryana and urban 
UP in 1976-77 to realise how little the transfer of power has done 
to diminish the force of the paradigm (of peasant insurgency) 
illustrated ... by 18th and 19th century events"" .18The inspiration 
that Guha's words provided to his younger colleagues in 
Subaltern Studies seems to be at work even today. Why else

hold a conference at the Gandhi Peace Foundation (ironies 
abound!) on March 20, 2007 on '1857 and the Legacy of 
Peasant Resistance' and give it the sub-title, 'Tebhaga, T elangana, 
Naxalbari and Now, Singur'? 19This, clearly, is an instance of not 
just celebrating a day on the national calendar but actually 
looking on 1857 as the precursor of many other rebellions to 
come. Thus, whether on the colonialist's side or on that of the 
historian of the Left, 1857 came to be codified into a general 
form of insurrection. By this code, 1857 is simply an incitement 
to popular politics, a call to insurgency. I have used the word 
""memorising"" to refer to this of silent process of codification, a

ERIC Stokes commented on the heat of reactions even in the 
late 20th century to the rebellion of 1857-58. He referred to the 
notorious scene of the massacre in Kanpur, the well down which 
victims were stuffed, and the site of a memorial from which 
Indians other than Christians were barred until independence. It was then replaced by a bronze effigy of Nana Sahib's general, 
Tatya Tope. This ""singularly tasteless and vicious reprisal"" was 
curious evidence of the power of symbols, according to Stokes. The memory of European dead was desecrated while more 
numerous Indian victims of British atrocities went without 
memorial. For both India and Pakistan, Stokes argued, the 
rebellion had become ""the formative violence of their national 
history, the proof that colonialism had been withstood even 
unto blood"" . 1 Is this why the revolt is still so prominent in the 
popular imagination, in India today as it was in Britain in the 
later 19th century? I suggest that the key aspect is that it is 
regarded not just as a mutiny in the Indian army and an uprising 
in regions of India but as an Indian revolt against the British. ""Indians rose against East India Company rule"", according to 
one recent historian.2 It is said without reflection. The rebellion 
was thus a crucial stage and expression of two nations in making. This essay is about the characterisation of the revolt. Definitions matter. States are built from sentiment and loyalty 
as well as from self-interest and force. Of course technological 
and material changes are important to the creation of nations, 
but they act on the ways people see themselves and their ability 
to combine. Conditions and understanding are shaped by 
economic and political power, but the processes are complex. 60

Nations develop (as do labour relations and the mode of 
production) not only from the logic of capitalism but also 
because of resistance, protest and law, which are expressions of 
ideas and experience. Put another way, there is the power of 
capitalists or politicians or generals, but also the power of 
context, organisation and rhetoric. These are distinct forms that 
interact. 3 To return to the subject of this paper: the great rebellion 
of 1857-58 was crucial largely because of its impact on percep­
tions and terminology. It was - another point from Stokes - one 
of a wave of revolts from Europe in 1848 to Taiping and Nien 
after 1858; but all they had in common was failure. 4 The Indian 
uprising mattered greatly because British rule was restored but 
would have mattered much more if the British had been thrown

out of India. Its material consequences were minor by compari­
son with its impact on the mind:' 
I In the 1890s H G Keene (of the Indian Civil Service, 1847-
1882) wrote a history of India for students and colleges. It was 
produced by W H Allen and Co, ""Publishers to the India 
Office"".6 It blamed the mutiny and revolt on over-ambitious 
changes introduced by Dalhousie, policies that challenged the 
""two main classes of the Natives"" (Hindus and Muslims) who 
though not uncivilised were ""at an earlier stage of human 
development"" and thus found the ""ideas and practices of 
Christendom ... unintelligible"". Hindus objected to attempts to 
curb the polygamy of ""certain classes of Brahmins"" and feared 
for the corruption by English ideas of young babus in Bengal. Muslims were alarmed at the deposing of the Nawab of Awadh, 
the threats to Delhi, and the loss of elite employment; they 
ignored the sage advice that under Islamic law they were 
neither required nor permitted to rebel against the British. (This infantilising of Indians and the listing of their ""irrational"" 
prejudices were hackneyed well before the rebellion.) Keene then acknowledged the multiplicity of more material 
motives in 1857. Soldiers objected to their conditions and 
especially to overseas campaigns. In Awadh, Henry Lawrence 
faced a combination of the high and low, offended by 
the annexation, injured in their property and privileges, or 
suffering hardship as a result of discharge from the army or
On the Rebellion of 1857: A Brief History of an Idea 61 
loss of trade after the demise of the court at Lucknow. But 
the verdict was that interference had been the problem, 
unlike in areas still ruled indirectly through their own chiefs. Keene then celebrated British military prowess, and the 
loyalty of the Sikhs. He cited some benefits of the victory 
such as an end to the Court of Directors, reorganisation of 
the army, the final expulsion of the Mughals. He offered both 
an historical analysis and a prospectus for successful British rule. It should be indirect as far as possible but firm and conducive 
to loyalty. Keene did recognise the importance of sentiment.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=72

the army, the final expulsion of the Mughals. He offered both 
an historical analysis and a prospectus for successful British rule. It should be indirect as far as possible but firm and conducive

the immediate loss of life, the interruption of business, and the 
financial burden, he considered there were major long-term 
costs from the ""suspension of all good feeling between the 
European community and the Native population"".7 In the 
classic early histories Kaye too had drawn attention to a broad 
and deep alienation from British rule, while Malleson (apart 
from savagely attacking Canning's ""weakness"") advanced an 
elaborate conspiracy theory. 8 Many contemporary officials 
blamed disaffected Muslims; and later that friend of Pakistan, 
Ian Stephen (among others) attributed a decline in Muslim 
fortunes to their consequent victimisation by the British.9 Saiyid 
Ahmad Khan made his initial reputation among the British by 
rebutting this supposed Islamic perfidy, while echoing those 
who blamed British incompetence. On the other hand, another 
contemporary official, Charles Metcalfe, thought Muslims too 
clumsy to plot whereas Hindus had a ""genius for conspiracy"". 10 
Muslim responsibility had been assumed from their alleged 
violence and fanaticism while Hindus were thought passive and 
fatalistic. In time rather more officials came round to Metcalfe's 
view as they faced Hindu protesters and revolutionaries, and 
sought to make allies of the Muslims. Even in the 1920s, 
Al Carthill (the pseudonym of B C Kennedy, ICS) was con­
vinced there had been a Hindu revolt in 1857, fomented out of 
the brahmanical supremacy that had arisen among the Marathas 
and that later would inspire those Hindu nationalists who 
reacted against western rule and knowledge. By Carthill­
Kennedy's account, the rebellion was an early part of ""a secular 
war with the west"" that would eventually grip both Hindus 
and Muslims. 11

1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
Whatever the butt of the accusations, in such colonial histo­
ries we find the familiar tropes of contented and ignorant dupes 
led astray by cynics or fanatics, and of secret combinations 
among opponents unknown to the British. They were not 
devised in 1857, and are arguably inherent in the attitudes of all 
governments. But certainly the many accounts of mutiny and 
revolt gave them credence and publicity. Elements were 
repeated many times in a wide range of different situations 
during colonial rule. They were applied, we may note, parti­
cularly to religions as units of political analysis and fitted neatly 
with stereotypes about Indian religiosity. Other colonial writers were concerned to minimise or explain 
away disaffection among Indians.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=73

during colonial rule. They were applied, we may note, parti­
cularly to religions as units of political analysis and fitted neatly 
with stereotypes about Indian religiosity. Other colonial writers were concerned to minimise or explain 
away disaffection among Indians. These conclusions too had 
their roots in current policy and attitudes. Rice Holmes thought 
he ""ought to reserve his detailed narrative for events of historical 
importance"". The choices he made are plain to see. His much 
re-printed book, first published in 1883, was called in full A 
History of the Indian Mutiny and of the disturbances which accompanied 
it among the civil population. 12The title says it all. Holmes concluded 
that the mutiny could have been prevented by better treatment 
of the army, better discipline, and a higher proportion of 
European troops. But once the army had rebelled ""no power on 
earth could have prevented quasi-rebellious disturbances"". Just 
as the ""lawless and tyrannical barons"" of twelfth-century En­
gland took advantage of King Stephen's weakness and later 
chafed against the strong and just Henry Plantagenet, or as 
London ""thieves and roughs"" would foment a ""violent outburst 
of crime"" if the police were to mutiny, ""so would the talukdars, 
the dispossessed landholders, the Gujars, and the 'budmashes' 
of India have welcomed the first symptom of governmental 
weakness as a signal for gratifying their selfish instincts"". In 
short, government weakness would promote self-interested 
rebellion anywhere, and this one (we note) was created by 
disappointed lawless nobility and opportunistic criminals. There 
was more infantilising here too: some of the rebels, wrote 
Holmes, were like ""schoolboys who, though prepared to rever­
ence authority, must find a vent for their inborn love of mischief 
when they feel that their master is powerless to control them"". 13 
Then, shifting his ground, Holmes admitted that there might 
have been some civil resentment, but stated that if so it was by
On the Rebellion of 1857: A Brief History of an Idea 63 
the few over measures taken to protect the many. Thus, in some 
late 19th century British accounts it was no longer acceptable to 
think that undue interference by Dalhousie and Canning had 
stirred up feelings and caused a popular rebellion. The duty of 
government to promote improvement had been too often 
proclaimed. The problem in 1857 had been insufficiently stem 
and effective control, and the opposition of old elites that 
had deserved to be dispossessed.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=74

government to promote improvement had been too often 
proclaimed. The problem in 1857 had been insufficiently stem 
and effective control, and the opposition of old elites that 
had deserved to be dispossessed. That shrewd well-connected 
conservative official Harcourt Butler quoted Sir Alfred Lyall: 
""The wild fanatic outbreak of 1857 was reactionary in its causes 
and revolutionary in its effects. It shook for a moment the 
empire's foundations, but it cleared the way for reconstruction 
and improvement."" Pausing only to reflect on Indian autocracy 
and potential for sudden violence, Butler thus moved on rapidly 
to the ""moving language"" of Queen Victoria's conciliatory 
proclamation (1858). 14 
At first sight a French commentator and admirer of the British 
empire seemed to combine these opposing British perspectives 
in another study of the rebellion, published in English a little 
before Keene and Holmes. To Eugene de Valbezen the out­
breaks in 1857 could be attributed to latent indiscipline in the 
army and a ""mad panic produced by the spirit of caste"" - a 
mixture of ""passion and weakness"". He thought the most 
remarkable thing about the British empire was its imposition by 
so few upon so many, when the British unlike the Mughals had 
attempted no social connection with their subjects. The Indian 
empire could be personified as a British master who preserved 
his nationality and exclusivity, separated by ""an impassable 
barrier from the natives he has despoiled"". Even modern 
civilisation had ""passed over the soil of India without making 
any impression in it"". Nonetheless the revolt was not national­
istic. The Hindus felt jealousy or even hatred towards their 
foreign rulers, but ""in this strange land patriotism does not exist, 
the feeling of nationality, of independence finds no echo in the 
population"" . 15 So it seems that de Valbezen was a child of the 
revolution who equated nationality and liberty, and also a 
disciple of the assimilative project of empire undertaken by the 
French. He did not see the signs that an appreciation of aspects 
of ""modem civilisation"" by wealthy and educated Indian elites 
would help the British to remain in India for generations to

come. Nor did he give weight to the fact that British rule was not 
sustained or sustainable only by the small mainly European 
body of men who formed the Indian Civil Service and the officer 
corps of th.: army. II 
Among Indians, parallel or related differences of view were 
also closely connected to underlying attitudes to issues of the 
day. The most heated debates concerned the nationalistic 
character of the revolt. VD Savarkar famously dubbed it India's 
first war of independence; later his followers appropriated it for 
a Hindu history. Savarkar justified violent resistance, noted 
Hindu-Muslim cooperation in 1857, and rejected ""Muslim 
domination""·16 After the transfer of power, S B Chaudhuri and 
R C Majumdar had a celebrated tussle over whether or not it 
was a popular uprising. Their exchanges summed up the range 
of meanings attributed to the rebellion in the early years after 
independence. 17 Their significance will be discussed later. Different aspects were also contained within the conclusions of 
S N Sen who found that there had been a spontaneous revolt 
from all sections of the people. He admitted that law-breakers 
were not necessarily patriots. He studied the multiplicity of 
actions and motives that combined in the rebellion. He agreed 
that ""the conception of Indian nationality was yet in embryo"" 
and that there was ""no conception of individual liberty"" either. Given the brutality on all sides, this was certainly not a war 
between civilisation and barbarism. Nor were Indians pitted 
against Europeans, because there were at least 20 Indians for 
every European on the Company side, combatants as well as 
camp-followers. However, Sen asserted, there was nonetheless a 
""main movement"" that was a popular revolt of a ""national"" 
character. The historian was struggling with the patriot, and at 
first the patriot won. He decided: ""No dependent nation can for 
ever reconcile itself to foreign domination"". Then the historian 
rallied: ""The educated Indian at first had no faith in armed 
rebellion, and the failure of the revolt confirmed him in his 
conviction. _He placed his hopes in British liberalism.""",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=76

thus deferred presumably prepared for the partial fulfilment that 
was the active but mainly non-violent opposition led by Gandhi. On the Rebellion of 1857: A Brief History of an Idea 65 
Abul Kalam Azad, in his preface to Sen's book, wrote with a 
deliberate balance that summed up the spirit of his cohort of 
Congress leaders. 19 It was, he said, now time for objective 
history. The rebellion ought not be a matter of political polemic, 
as it had been when it was claimed to be a war for the lost 
privileges of the nobility. Rather, he declared, Indian national 
character had sunk so low that no agreed leadership could be 
found to unite the people. Disjointed protests faced an organised 
and cohesive foe. Even Tatya Tope fled to Maratha territories 
expecting protection and was hunted down in the forests after 
being betrayed by a friend. Azad did not need to add that, since 
then, the Congress had shown Indians how to mobilise and 
resist. Yet even in 1857 (he also remarked, with an eye to the 
present and the personal and to Hindu chauvinists that under­
mined his rejection of propaganda) there had been remarkable 
cooperation between Hindus and Muslims, and deep residual 
loyalty to Mughal suzerainty. The British overthrow of Mughal 
rulers and lack of respect for Indian susceptibilities had fired the 
rebellion. At the time Azad was president of India. He did not 
need to worry when he contradicted himself. General crisis theories have basically believed in a clash of 
cultures. If not over religion, then it was (following the famous 
account by Buckler)20 a struggle for political legitimacy. Charles 
Metcalfe, anticipating de Valbezen, claimed to recall a growing 
disaffection as British authority was extended with ""a cold, 
unyielding hand"" .11 Some hav'e proposed a broad economic 
dislocation. However, that is complex and controversial. Stokes 
emphasised the Company's caution. Bayly and others identified 
economic and political continuities well into the 19th century. Even among those who believe in significant British impact, 
there was no unanimity about the damage caused by Company 
and colonial rule. Morris and McAlpin made often-challenged 
assumptions about the impact of markets and the nature of the 
colonial state that implied an improvement (at least after the 
1850s) rather than a decline in general well-being. 22",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=77

Michael Mann's stimulating study identified major economic, 
social and ecological damage in north India even from the early 
years after British annexation, and an agricultural transforma­
tion carried on by cultivators who had to exploit the land 
beyond its ""natural capacity"". 2:i The real problem, however, is
66 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
not in showing economic or other general motives for the 
rebellion. It is that people who feel aggrieved have a choice of 
how to act. There may be passivity, avoidance, individual or 
group protest, political organisation, or insurrection. Common 
actions require not only a common purpose but generalisable 
means and understandings. Were these evident in 1857? Stokes sought particular explanations for peasants by study­
ing the varying details of their agrarian experience. It does not 
matter greatly to the argument that he concentrated on peasant 
uprisings and neglected the rebellions to the east and in 
Awadh. 24 His great contribution was his penetrating analysis of 
the material and local bases of the revolt in many areas. His 
arguments were of his time (and place, in Cambridge), when 
self-interest was placed above ideology, just as historical pro­
cesses outranked ""great men"". 25 Yet the cases analysed by him, 
augmented by others, show that the uprising was not a coordi­
nated event or even a related set of events. Rather it was a mass 
of separate happenings and responses that fed off each other. The extent and longevity of revolt related more to group 
cohesion than disadvantage. 2<; Stokes need not be understood 
as implying that Indian people had no ideas that shaped their 
experience, but only that such mentalite was not very generalised. The vivid diary of MunshiJeevan Lal, who was ""so terrified"" at 
the mutiny of the army that ""his heart almost ceased to beat"", 
supports the accidental and impromptu character of the revolt 
in Delhi. 27 Markovits uses the cliche of the prairie fire to

movement"" remains to this day a primary defence against him, 
while Stokes shows us instead that, in the main, 1857 was not a 
movement expressing generic interests, even though there may 
well have been common grievances. But it is being described as 
a general movement every time we talk of Indians and the 
British, or Hindus and Muslims. On the Rebellion of 1857: A Brief History of an Idea 67 
III The colonial and nationalist debates have a surprising amount 
in common. Both were ahistorical when they reached a level of 
generality. As said, the stereotypes in the images of 1857 were 
of two large opponents, Europeans and Indians, and of two 
components within India: Muslims and Hindus. We know that 
both are misleading. But both remain fundamental to almost all 
studies of the rebellion, and certainly are taken to be axiomatic 
in all popular accounts, both in India and in Britain. Let us 
consider them in reverse order. The second stereotype, that of Hindus and Muslims, has 
been much discussed and the ground need not be covered again 
in detail. Clearly Indians in 1857 did not obviously comprise the 
""two main classes"" identified by Keene. By this I do not mean 
that there was no recognisable Islamic sentiment or practice, or 
no long traditions of brahmanical and kshatriya, or shaivite and 
vaishnava - or for that matter anti-caste culture. Identities were 
re-imagined and re-focused in modem times, not invented. Actions throughout history had depended on very general 
allegiances across differing classes and regions. I have made this 
point about the so-called W ahhabis, 29 and it is evident in other 
popular, religious or political movements of the 19th century. General religious sentiment is also to be found among some of 
those participating in the rebellion. But what Eric Stokes 
showed was that the larger communal and social categories, 
much favoured when he was writing, and often adopted by 
subsequent polemicists, did not work very well to explain 
behaviour in 1857. There is an odd ambivalence about advancing such ideas.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=79

of power comes with faultless postcolonial credentials from 
Foucauldians and others who exaggerate the extent to which 
allegiances and categories were invented. However, it carries a 
disreputable colonialist tail. On one hand, there is the journalist 
and author Beverley Nichols (1898-1983) and his extraordinary 
attack on Hindus, Gandhi and the ""fascist"" Congress, written 
before the fall of Hitler. He began with the standard denial that 
""Indians"" existed and nearly 200 pages later reached his apo­
theosis in an interview with Jinnah, Asia's ""most important
68

man"" and the ""most competent to solve"" one of the world's 
greatest problems. Jinnah had told him that Indian Muslims' 
outlook was fundamentally different and often radically antago­
nistic towards the Hindus because they were ""different beings"" 
and there was ""nothing in life that linked"" them together.30 On 
the other hand, one might consider the liberal imperial apolo­
gist, Edwyn Bevan, who typically justified empire by the service 
it provided to India, while also condemning the lack of imagi­
nation in Englishmen when it came to encouraging Indian 
advancement. He believed in the ""simple-hearted content"" of 
the millions of Indians. And he also saw a great barrier not just 
in the big communal divisions, but in ""all that disintegration of 
India into little societies with their few common interests"".31 Any insistence on India's disunity has unfortunate echoes, 
therefore, of all those Englishmen who excused their empire 
with an infuriating air of superiority - as if it was more than just 
a conquest to keep out the French and keep the natives quiet. Thus they hark back to the comparative social history of Henry 
Maine, with civilisations at different stages of development. Bevan imagined that, however ""deplorable the interior condi­
tion of a foreign country might be, an English statesman would 
not be likely to propose to his people to annex [it} out of pure 
philanthropy"".32 From Bevan's own example we might say that 
few English statesmen in possession of an empire would refrain 
from proclaiming their altruism.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=80

had its advantages for India, 33 and now compound the offence 
by denying that Hindus and Muslims operated as fully unitary 
categories in 1857, let alone as great battalions fighting in a 
common cause. It then follows that the first stereotype of the 
rebellion as a conflict between nations is equally suspect. Here 
we come back to the ""main movement"" of irreconcilable 
national resentment. Could it have been a matter of race, after 
all? I do not underestimate the ferocity of the rebellion and its 
suppression. Violent animosity was expressed in the massacre 
in Kanpur and in the barbaric destruction wreaked by the 
returning British forces on foe and bystander alike. Rage was 
also directed on all sides against religious buildings and other 
symbols of opposing systems or ideologies. Many writers, from 
the very first, referred to deep distrust of British rule. Mainodin On the Rebellion of 1857: A Brief History of an Idea

Hassan Khan's narrative, in Metcalfe's translation, claims that 
the English were ""regarded as trespassers"" from the first. He 
attributed the disaffection to Indian oppressors rather than the 
poor, and believed that there had been a conspiracy. 34 There is 
also much evidence of cultural misunderstanding or race hatred 
in the contemporary European press and in later memoirs 
and tales. Canning's ""clemency"" was despised by many of 
his countrymen, who agreed with Holmes that the rebellion

possible to think towards a common culture and certainly a 
common allegiance, but in the 1850s even more than now there 
were multiple cultures and loyalties. Was this ""modern"" rule 
under Dalhousie and Canning really more generally intrusive or 
more offensive for northern India than its predecessors even 
its Company predecessors in Madras, Bengal and Bombay? Rulers annoy lots of people all the time, and the Company 
certainly irritated many in north India in the 1850s. But there is 
little evidence of a general revulsion at its alien character - more 
than there had been to, say, Vijayanagar or the Deccani sultans 
or Aurangzeb or Portuguese Goa or Tipu Sultan. Did those 
'sipahis', whose families may have been serving the Company 
for generations, suddenly decide at Meerut that they objected 
on principle to taking the coin of the 'firinghi' or 'mleccha'? Did 
the poor cultivator in Awadh reject the new rule as foreign (as 
opposed to illegitimate) even supposing he had understood the 
annexation of 1856? Markovits, attributing the defeat of the 
rebellion partly to British ruthlessness, writes that 'certains 
elements indigenes, sikhs et Gurkha (soldats nepalais)' played 
an important part in the British victory. 35 Were they traitors? What did it mean, in 1857, to be indigenous or Nepali? For the rebellion to have been a reaction against ""foreign"" 
rule, the two sides would have needed to be ""Indian"" and 
""British"" or ""Hindu"" /'Muslim"" and ""European"". Ethnicity has

to be at the heart of any so-called ""Indian"" revolt against 
""British"" rule. But this was not a war between races, though its 
viciousness was portrayed as such. Nor was it a war between 
advanced and backward civilisations. The fact that the rebels 
were not ""Indians"" is the real message of Stokes' revisions about 
the nature of the uprisings and their motives. At a superficial 
level this is obvious because of the participants: the mix of 
supporters and enemies of the British within most of the obvious 
social, religious and political categories and in different regions, 
alongside the large numbers who held aloof or changed sides or 
followed a narrow self-interest. What of the ""British""? One 
cannot simply forget the aforementioned Sikhs and other 
indigenous combatants, or the Bengalis who had migrated 
upcountry with British rule and in some cases became victims 
of the revolt. Metcalfe noted that ""Amidst the bloodshed and 
violence there were found natives loyal and true, whose minds 
remained unaffected by the madness of the times"". 36 Again, 
everyone knows this and forgets it. Ignoring evidence is the way 
of legend. It is the impulse that in Attenborough's film Gandhi 
depicted a composite Indian government as a full table-load of 
pompous and braided Europeans. History relates that it con­
tained three well known Indians but that would have spoilt the 
story. It would have confused the dramatic simplicity of the 
image - arguably (I do not deny) its dramatic truth. In 1857, too, 
the rebels' opponents were not ""British"" if many different kinds 
of people fought with the returning armies or sustained the 
government in the rest of the subcontinent. Many Indians 
whether from loyalty or common humanity also gave succour to 
European and Christian fugitives. If popular and even scholarly 
history glosses over these inconvenient complications, that tells 
us more about the afterlife of the idea of the rebellion than about 
the rebellion itself. IV What were the consequences of this characterisation of the 
Mutiny as a conflict of communities and nations? To put it 
another way, what was the context of the heated debates about 
the nature of the rebellion not only among the European rulers 
but among Indians soon after independence? Reasons for the 
British colonial debates have already been suggested and are

too obvious to need further elaboration. I will not pursue here 
the representation of the revolt by Hindu nationalists. But more 
can still be said about the Indian reactions. There were two models of modern nationhood presented to 
India during colonial rule. They are not usually separated, 
though they have been implicitly by scholars of international 
law, for example by James Crawford in a volume discussing the 
extension of the concept of rights. He advanced a thoroughly 
intermingled definition of the state as the ""social fact of a 
territorial community of persons with a certain political 
organisation"". But he then went on, drawing on Sieghart's 
definitions, to distinguish between rights relating to sovereignty 
and rights relating to the continuity of groups. 37 Similarly, the 
first concept of the state that I identify is based around territory. It was reinforced by claims to sovereignty through regulation 
and policy, and by notions of national interest and state 
responsibility. 38 It produced citizens of the land and the law. It 
was potentially multicultural. Heterogeneity of class and culture 
was immaterial to this nationalism because of the common place 
of birth, the common allegiance to a state, the common subjec­
tion to rules, and the common involvement in a national project. This nationality was constructed from actions, jurisdictions and 
benefits defined within bounded space. As Sugata Bose put it, 
""modern colonial empires drew heavily from the model of 
European nation states in their centralised structures and uni­
tary ideologies of sovereignty, and they bequeathed these to 
postcolonial nation states"". 39 Nicholas Dirks too has come to 
recognise that it is not possible to reconstruct Indian under­
standings of sovereignty in isolation from European debates. 40 
The second model of nationhood depended on ethnicity and 
culture. It became important in the history of modern states, 
especially for its rhetorical force. Here were citizens by type, or 
the nation as community. It was effectively monocultural. A 
fundamental homogeneity had to be imagined, regardless of 
class or other conflicting interests, though of course within 
perceivable limits and affinities. One touchstone was the 
degree of constitutional prominence given to the idea of 
representation. If self-determination were the goal, then the 
""self' had to be defined. Few if any of those participating in 
the rebellions of 1857 would have understood either of these

concepts of the nation, and the leaders would have opposed

as an idea. In Europe and America, where most of these concepts 
originated, both elements had tended to come together, but 
always as a process of linking two distinguishable rationales. In 
the British Isles there was an imperfect conjuncture between the 
United Kingdom as a space and the British as a people. The 
match was better within the constituent states of the union, but 
at times a necessary commonality was accepted between rich 
and poor, or Protestant, Catholic and Jew, or Scottish and 
English. At other times it was fractured. Britain also oscillated 
between the two models in its plans and laws, sometimes 
attempting a common citizenship for far-flung peoples in a 
Commonwealth, and at other times restricting entry to the 
United Kingdom except for the descendants of former (white) 
emigrants. In the US the identity of space has predominated so far, 
because diverse peoples were defined as American by their 
arrival on shore and their usurpation and settlement of the land, 
even when they retained versions of pre-existing identities and 
cultures. It is no accident that when native Americans had to be 
conciliated they were given ""reservations"", or that the majority 
demand of the excluded blacks (despite the exceptions from 
Liberia to the Rastafarians or black Muslims) was to have full 
rights as Americans, as citizens of the republic. To this day, the 
president must be American-born, and a degree of plurality is 
assumed within the American way. Germany, however, was a different case. Its unity was created 
out of hundreds of political units, and so depended ultimately 
on the Volk, on language and culture. The atrocities of the third 
Reich were a pathological extension of that logic. Hitler did not 
demand the integrity of German land and borders; he sought 
the purity of the supposed German race and its 'Lebensraum'. Despite that warning, in the later twentieth century the resident 
'Gastarbeiten' remained ""guests"", the East Germans were al­
ways part of a putative single German nation, and Russian 
""Germans"" absent for generations and often ""deculturated"" had 
rights to ""return"" and to belong, just like the Germans of the 
Sudetenland before them.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=85

unity, while Greeks, Czechs, Hungarians and Catholic Irish 
sought to distinguish themselves from larger units or stronger 
neighbours. It was as peoples that they demanded to be nations. Palestinians and Kurds too have sought land to express their 
separate nationalities. The Zionist insistance on Israel, a land for 
the Jews, was another example of the same idea. The demand 
for Pakistan and the claims of Hindutva are others. The home­
land expressed the people and preserved them wherever they 
are, which is the mirror image of the citizenry defined and 
contained by the bounded state. Partition and even ethnic 
""cleansing"" are never too far away with this model of nationality 
as a people. In south Asia, as elsewhere, the two models or elements co­
existed and overlapped. On the one hand, the whole tendency 
of British rule was towards the creation of a unitary state within 
borders. In the early years fantasies about place and climate 
encouraged distinctions between British-born and ""country­
bom"" Europeans (though mixed race was also an issue). From 
the later 19th century, passports were issued to travellers and 
pilgrims. All residents were ""subjects"" and their dissent was 
""sedition"". In the early 20th century the Round Table group and 
others proposed an imperial federation that included India. At that time Muslims could support Turkey, the Caliph, the 
Red Crescent, and the 'umma' that was the worldwide commu­
nity of Islam, and yet be Indian nationalists or loyal subjects of 
the empire. On the other hand, the British were obsessed with religious 
communities and ethnicities. The first was more important to 
them than the second, and indeed everywhere nationalities 
were mostly cultural. Except in the worst excesses of ""scientific"" 
racism, such as the Nazis' vile selection of ""Aryans"" among the

Renaissance. The Irish did so from suffering and song. So it was 
that Greek independence, Italian unification, Irish freedom 
and also Japanese and later Chinese nation-building were
74 
7857: Essays from Economic and Political Week01 
appropriate exemplars for India. It was from such comparisons 
that many claimed that India could never be a nation because 
of its plurality and political division. However, Indians too sought histories and characteristics to 
define themselves. Race, despiteJinnah's claims, was little more 
than a confusing surrogate for the affinities of culture and history. The very existence of multiple jurisdictions required Indian 
nationalists to emphasise history, culture, regional economy 
and broad geography. The nationalists depended upon the 
assertion of popular identities within or beyond pre-existing 
political units, rather than on any one existing state, in their 
search for national identity. Thus they ran the risk of communal 
divisions that turned into political boundaries, and also of other 
secessions (Sikhs, dalits, Dravidians) that were avoided. At the 
same time, some writers those we have seen and many others 
- worked themselves into a fury to disparage Indian character 
and customs. Here too the obvious response for Indians was to 
celebrate and re-value culture, and to annex or give new 
meanings to the past, as when Bengalis celebrated Rajput annals, 
or Muslims or Hindus praised ""their"" glorious eras or moments, 
including their heroic sacrifices in 1857. As in Britain (where 
imperial and military exploits were acclaimed) this was both a 
product and a means of creating the identity of community. The balance between the opposing ideas changed over time. The first, territorial mode was dominant in India until about 
1920 and the second thereafter. The change of emphasis 
coincided with the recognition of common interests for ""Indi­
ans"" across the world, from Gandhi in South Africa to his friend

of the identity of community over that of political territory. The 
change around this time also was marked by the concession of 
self-government as a goal for India and the elaboration of 
national and nationalist institutions and policies: more represen­
tative legislature and executives, gradual Indianisation of the 
army and civil service, membership of international bodies, the 
enunciation of national strategies for development, trade, and 
foreign relations. Politicians had to seek out constituencies. Leaders were defined by followers as well as status. Religious 
symbols proved strong motivators of supporters. On the Rebellion of 1857: A Brief History of an Idea 75 
In this context, the Nehru Report (1928) sought compromise 
within an India union, and the Congress proclaimed its 
secularism, meaning neutrality between religions. But even 
these moves already acknowledged the political role of 
religious identity. Similarly, the original notion of Pakistan 
assumed a loose union and, to put it crudely, hostages on 
both sides, with many Muslims in India and many Hindus 
or Sikhs in undivided Bengal and Punjab. But this plural, 
territorial vision of nationhood was swallowed by the 
20th century dogma of self-determination. The boundary com­
mission was told to draw lines according to the majority 
religions at the sub-district level. It was an incitement to 
population transfer and murder. By this time the British rulers (though not all of British 
opinion) had come to believe that ""Indians"" existed and could 
be represented by leaders. It followed that there would have to 
be ""India"". The Montagu-Chelmsford report (1918) conceded 
that the Indian princely states had to be incorporated in some 
way within a single though federal polity. It argued too that 
territorial constituencies were needed to build a self-governing 
nation, just as an earlier generation of colonial officials had 
espoused mass education and local self-government with a 
promise of building civil society and participatory democracy. These were important steps, partly for pushing back racist 
stereotypes about who was capable of self-rule, and partly for

ruled led to talks and conferences among representatives that 
were supposed to produce a plural national unity, ultimately in 
a constituent assembly for India. But all these impulses were either inadequate or suppressed 
in practice. Mass education remained an under-funded dream. Communal electorates were politically expedient. The princely 
states were kept apart from directly-and then Indian-ruled 
provinces, an nnresolved problem that would cause lasting 
damage after independence. Thus in the great negotiations 
towards self-government that dragged on into the 1940s the 
territorial and the plural declined in significance. The attempt 
to create the nation as territory was flawed. 76 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry It is true despite that failure between Pakistani Muslims and 
Hindus, that plurality remained a firm and necessary goal in 
India, and efforts to promote it have helped preserve the union. The weakness or ambiguity of plurality in Pakistan contributed 
to its dismemberment in 1971. On the other hand, India's 
position on national identity remains confused. It is notorious 
that Gandhi was a leader who espoused harmony while valuing 
and using religion, and who fought to incorporate dalits in an 
identity that discriminated against them; and that Jawaharlal 
Nehru was a liberal socialist and internationalist who despised 
the feudal mindset of religious politics but expressed quasi­
mystical reverence for an Indian cultural essence. His annex­

principles of the new state. 41 In what would be a contravention 
of British laws (if they applied in these cases), the Indian 
government has offered visa privileges to British-born persons 
of south Asian descent (provided they have ""Hindu"" names), 
while giving fewer privileges to other British applicants. On the 
other hand, confusingly, it required British citizens with south 
Asian ""Muslim"" names to prove that their parents were not born 
in what is now Pakistan. The representation of the rebellion of 1857-58 as an ""Indian 
revolt"" provided a myth, a history and heroes, of the cultural or 
ethnic kind. Sikhs and the many others who fought with the 
British were thus traitors to their national identity, though this 
uncomfortable conclusion is glossed over in such accounts. By 
contrast Queen Victoria's proclamation, also much noticed by 
aspirant sectors of the people of India, was an enunciation of the

territorial principle and of plurality whereby all subjects of the 
Crown were entitled to equality of respect and treatment, 
whatever their creed or race. The colonial arguments about 
1857 were thus in part arguments about the nature of India and 
the way it should be ruled. Indian arguments after Indepen­
dence were similarly debates about Indian nationhood. They 
continue to this day. Is there a multicultural polity or a mono­
cultural identity? The answer could be discerned in what 
happened in 1857-58, whether or not there was a ""main move­
ment"" that was a ""national"" rejection of the ""foreigner"". I do not 
say that individuals necessarily recognised what they were 
arguing about, though some did (such as Savarkar). I suggest the 
debates were in parallel at a subliminal level. In particular, the 
afterlife of the rebellion, by posing a conflict of all ""classes"" 
between indigenous and alien, or Indian and British, helped 
forge a necessary history of both nations as identities. NOTES

regarded it only as an instrument of class oppression. But its mixed character

Aftermath of Revolt. India, 7857- 7870, Princeton 1964, that there was 
much continuity in colonial policy before and after 1857. That is somewhat 
qualified by the misrule and neglect of the tenantry in favour of the 
landholders in Awadh, as discussed injagdish Raj, The Mutiny and British

Multiple Meanings of 1857 
for Indians in Britain 
Michael H Fisher 
NEWS .from India about the bloody fighting of 1857 shocked 
people in Britain, including the thousands of Indians of all 
classes settled or sojourning there. Each Indian living in London 
or elsewhere in Britain had to decide whether the anti-British 
violence by many of their countrymen in India was justified. Further, each also had to choose how to act toward Britons, 
including British lover, wife or husband, friend, employer, or 
passer-by on the street. Virtually all Indians despite the variety 
of their backgrounds, personal feelings toward the fighting in 
India, or places in British society 
experienced rising British 
prejudice. Indian men in particular became the focus of British 
sexual fears. Consequently, many Indians in Britain felt even 
stronger solidarities with each other as they faced a collective 
hostility from the Britons around them. As demonstrated in this volume; prominent historians and 
other commentators have discussed many of the meanings of 
1857. Some have considered the disparate roles and responses 
of various Britons and Indians in India; others have analysed the 
opinions and public policies of Britons in Britain. This article 
complements that distinguished work by highlighting how the 
many and diverse Indians within British society related them­
selves to those events and also the ways in which British attitudes 
toward them altered prior to, during, and after 1857. HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF INDIANS IN BRITAIN TO 1857 While people from India have been travelling to Britain since

onward meant that ever more Indians of all classes decided to 
make this journey [Visram 2002; Fisher 2006; Fisher, Lahiri, 
Thandi 2007]. In India over the century prior to 1857, the East 
India Company conquered and annexed hundreds of kingdoms 
covering 1.6 million square kms and including roughly three­
quarters of the population; India's other 8,00,000 square kms 
and quarter of the population remained under approximately 
500-600 nominally sovereign Indian ""princes"" who kept their 
thrones but struggled under British indirect rule and feared 
annexation. All this made the East India Company the largest 
employer of Indians through its armies, civil administration and 
commercial undertakings. Additionally, most Indians had to 
deal in one way or another with the East India Company's 
revenue collectors, judicial courts, postal or educational 
systems, or political agents. Largely as a result of their forced relationship with Britons and 
British authorities, a total of some 30,000 to 40,000 Indians had 
ventured to Britain by the early 1850s. Most went for work, 
particularly the thousands of 'lascars' (seamen) and male and 
female servants who went each year. Some of these labourers 
settled there, as did the wives of Britons and also various Indian 
entrepreneurs and teachers. Others, including students and 
tourists, visited temporarily in order to learn about the society 
and culture that had conquered India so rapidly and exten­
sively. Many others, including merchants, landholders, princes 
and employees of the British, who had found no redress for their 
grievances at the hands of British colonial officials or officers in 
India, believed that they would receive justice if they could 
personally present petitions directly to the British monarch, 
parliament,judicial system, or the East India Company's court of 
directors. Enough of these appellants did indeed obtain redress 
or advancement ( or at least promises of these) for more Indians 
to be encouraged to make this journey. Some found employment 
as landlords, advisors, servants or translators for later Indian 
arrivals. All learned from personal experience living there 
about broader British society, the global context of colonialism 
and the possibilities for action. None of these perspectives were 
as visible from the confines of colonised India.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=96

or her background, both collective (socio-economic class, reli­
gious community, gender and regional origin) and individual 
(degree of Anglicisation, physical features and particular per­
sonal relationships and circumstances). Many Britons had inter­
acted easily with Indians who appeared to be of their own socio­
economic class and regarded Indian aristocrats as comparable 
with European peers. Britons identified Indians using a wide 
and imprecise range of terms and categories including 
""Asiatic"", ""Oriental"", ""Orientalist"", ""East Indian"", ""Indian"" and 
""Black"", occasionally classing them together with Africans, 
Afro-Caribbean people and foreigners generally. The very 
vagueness of British understanding of what it meant to be 
""Indian"" gave scope to early Indians to shape to some degree 
how they were received by the Britons around them. Some Indians had chosen to merge into British society, 
appreciating the relative acceptance of them by Britons of their 
own economic class, compared to the more racially-divided 
situation in colonial India. In 1844, one scholar-diplomat in 
London contrasted relatively welcoming British society with the 
condescending or contemptuous attitudes of Britons in India: 
""The fact is, that the more you proceed on towards England, the 
more you find the English people endowed with politeness and 
civility .... "" [Lutfullah 1857]. Many Indians, including virtually all 
Indian settlers, had Anglicised their dress, deportment and 
names, converted (at least nominally to Christianity) and mar­
ried a Briton. Symptomatic of British acceptance oflndians were 
the high levels of intermarriage by Indian men and women with 
native Britons. Many Indian male visitors and settlers had long regarded 
their own relatively easy familiarity with British women in 
Britain as empowering; numerous Indian male authors sug­
gested or explicitly discussed this phenomenon (which Tavakoli­
Targhi labels ""Euroeroticism"" [Tavakoli-Targhi 1993]). Indeed, 
the situation in the metropole powerfully contrasted to that in 
India where British colonialists had long strongly asserted their 
racial separation and superiority, and especially stressed the 
prevention of social or sexual relations between British women 
and Indian men.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=97

personal self-esteem, but also for providing an entree into 
British society and an appreciation of Indian gender morality in 
contrast to Britain sexual laxity. Eventually, however, British military conquests and growing 
colonial empire in Asia convinced most Britons of the inherent 
supremacy of their culture and race. Missionaries and other 
""reformers"" increasingly asserted the superiority of Christianity 
and British values over conquered Asian peoples. British stereo­
types about non-Whites sporadically but increasingly entered 
metropolitan society from the colonies, making it ever more 
difficult for many Indians living in British society to shape how 
they would be received. Conversely, as British cultural assertions came to dominate 
the Indian colonialised, the expectations held by people about 
to leave for Britain shifted. As Partha Chatterjee explains, in 
contrast to an 18th century Indian visitor who had no ""prior 
mental map imprinted on his mind telling him how England 
ought to be seen"", a late 19th century one already knew what he 
would find: He ""would have no doubt that what he was 
experiencing, and what he would need to convey to his country­
men back home, was a moral and civilisational essence, ex­
pressed in such virtues of the modern English people as the spirit 
of independence, self-respect and discipline, their love for art, 
literature and sport, and above all, their cultivation of know­
ledge"" [Chatterjee 1998]. During the decades leading up to 1857, many Indians in 
Britain developed class and other solidarities with each other to 
support them in this alien environment. The largest community 
of working-class Indians emerged in London's east end docklands. From the 1790s until 1834, the East India Company contracted 
with British entrepreneurs to provide barracks for transient 
Indian seamen until they could be shipped back to India.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=98

particular, the massive barracks off the Ratcliffe Highway not far 
from east London's docks formed the centre of a substantial 
Indian working-class community composed not only of Indian 
lascars, but also of dismissed servants and the occasional 
impoverished diplomat. In 1834, parliament's suspension for 20 
years of the East India Company's charter to trade in India 
ended the contract for this barracks. This community of lascars 
and other Indians then moved slightly east to London's Poplar
Multiple Meanings of 1857 for Indians in Britain 85 
and Limehouse area, even nearer the East India Docks. There 
arose an array of private lodging houses, often under the 
managements of Indian entrepreneurs attended by their British 
wives or mistresses, anchoring a service-based and Indian­
centred community widely known as the ""Oriental Quarter"". This neighbourhood provided congenial living space and enter­
tainment to transient Indian seamen, with an estimated 3,000-
3,600 arriving annually in the early 1850s [Visram 1986: 52]. Other Indians, even if they lived elsewhere, including servants 
of diplomatic delegations, also visited this neighbourhood for 
the distinctively Indian companionship, cuisine, entertainment, 
and other pleasures available there. Reflecting growing British distrust of this self-regulated Orien­
tal Quarter in the imperial capital, Christian missionaries and 
other social reformers established a replacement for it, an 
institution that was under their control. In 1842, the Church 
Missionary Society surveyed and reported the State of the 
Lascars in London. Evangelicals proposed a charity house, and 
gathered £15,000 (including Indian donations totalling£ 5,000) 
to fund it. In 1856, 'The Strangers' Home for Asiatics, Africans, 
and South Sea Islanders' opened in Commercial-road, 
Limehouse, under its secretary and manager, lieutenant-colonel 
R Marsh Hughes, late of the East India Company's army. This 
institution's name linked various ethnicities of the working 
classes collectively as ""Strangers"", reflecting current British 
attitudes.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=99

for their employment on the passage home. During the early 19th century as well, the increasingly numer­

provided centres for distinctly Indian social life there. Some 30 
embassies from deposed or threatened Indian princes, or the 
princes themselves, had reached London by 1857. Once in 
Britain, the most effective among these ambassadors including 
Raja Rammohun Roy who lived there during the last three years 
of his life (1831-33) representing Mughal emperor Muhammad 
Akbar II learned about and manoeuvred through the world of 
British politics, often aligning with British opposition politicians

obtained enhanced pensions and influence in high British 
society including with the British monarch. While no official 
British policies in India were reversed by the lobbying and 
bribing done by these Indian delegations, colonial officials 
apparently restrained themselves somewhat from particularly 
egregious annexations or other imperial assertions by the 
knowledge that their deeds would face hostile scrutiny in 
London. Some of these missions included large numbers of men 
and women of all classes. For example, the delegation from

aristocrats also provided spaces for hierarchic socialising among 
the various other Indian visitors and settlers in London, as well 
as various British supporters and hangers-on, each class in its 
own place. In the finest rooms, Indian elites met and exchanged 
their experiences of British society and politics. Accounts from 
both Indian and British sources recorded the various gatherings 
among these men and women, as they ( divided by gender and 
often religious community): dined in various configurations; 
celebrated each others' holidays; and commiserated over their 
respective successes and frustrations dealing with British autho­
rities and society. 1 Simultaneously, the many scribes and other 
attendants attached to these missions likewise shared their own 
quarters and views with each other and with Indians of their

other delegations and other working-class Indians joined this 
gathering: The inmates of Harley House [the members of the Awadh delegation 
which arrived in 1856], however, were not long in discovering that a 
colony of Orientals was already established in London, and their 
number was soon increased by deserters from ships, and the Asiatic 
vagrants of the metropolis, and all soon made acquaintance with the 
suite of the N awab of Surat. Some of them came into the kitchen of the 
Nawab ... winter was then approaching and the cold autumnal winds 
blew with terrible effect on the naked legs of the visitors. English boots 
and stockings were produced by the servants of the N awab; the boots 
were examined and approved of, but the stockings excited deep 
curiosity, and were the subject of much discussion as they were handed 
about for inspection. Thus, the shared experiences in dealing with conditions in 
London bonded these Indians from different regions and cul­
tures into a solidarity, and the accumulated knowledge of earlier 
visitors passed orally to later ones. British public opinion toward these often colourful Indian 
delegations proved mixed and shifted adversely against them 
over the first-half of the 19th century. On the one hand, these 
exotic-looking ambassadors and their entourages brought colour 
and panoply to London as an imperial capital. On the other

most superb by reason of the elaborate and costly dresses with which

filthy and unsightly group. Ranging on the basement floors of the hotel 
are large numbers continually to be seen lounging in the most careless 
manner, or squatting before a charcoal fire either cooking some article 
of food or indulging in the fumes derived from a dirty opium pipe. The 
entire floor of this portion of the hotel is strewed with the clothing of the 
inhabitants, and in appearance much resembles the back premises of 
an extensive rag merchant, the whole being rendered more unpleasant 
by the quantity of dirt which each article of dress apparently contains

they have been occupied; and we do not doubt that it will be at 
least as many more days before the establishment will be again

September 1, 1856]. Thus, British racial prejudice was rising in 
Britain even before news of the events of 1857 reached them. Many of the Indians in Britain during the decades leading up 
to 1857 recognised how expanding British colonialism and 
racial prejudice against Indians generally should bond Indians 
together. Mixing in London with people from many other 
Indian regions often overcame traditional cultural and political 
distinctions more effectively than was occurring in India at this 
time. Particularly articulate both about such British discrimina­
tion and also the need for a collective response to British 
aggression was Maratha diplomat, Rango Bapojee, who spent 
13 years in London (1839-53). In 1842, Bapojee complained in 
writing there about slights he had personally received and the 
""oppression set upon our race and colour"" collectively by 
prejudiced Britons [Bapojee letters January 24, 1842, March 12,

""the hundred and 50 millions of my fellow-countrymen"" [Bapojee 
1846, p 2]. In 1849, Bapojee wrote a rallying ""Circular to Princes 
and Chiefs in India"", which he sent to all the Indian rulers back 
in India, warning them against the insidious British practice of 
piecemeal annexation that was evident only from the perspec­
tive of Britain. Before he left Britain in utter frustration at how 
he had been mistreated by both British authorities and also 
particularly racist members of the British public, Bapojee passed 
on his hard-earned experience to newly arriving diplomats, 
including Azimullah Khan who, along with Mohammed Ali 
Khan, represented in London the exiled Maratha Peshwa 
Dhundu Pant, ""Nana Sahib"" from 1853-55. Azimullah, both du;ing his three years in Britain as an 
ambassador and also later during the fighting of 1857, particu­
larly embodied the changes in British culture toward Indian 
men. Although received in some aristocratic British salons as a
90

peer, he apparently had arisen from lower-class origins. Losing 
his father while a child, he was fostered in Kanpur, UP, by British 
missionaries from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel 
in Foreign Parts, while his widowed mother allegedly worked as 
their 'ayah'. These missionaries taught him English and French 
and then used him as a teacher at their ""Cawnpore Free School"". Dhundu Pant was reportedly one of his students. Azimullah 
went on to serve as 'munshi' to British generals but, when 
accused of bribery and dismissed, he entered Dhundu Pant' s 
service in 1851. Azimullah then rose to the status of Dhundu 
Pant's diplomatic representative to the British in 1853. In Britain, Azimullah's reputation as a putative ""prince"" from 
the ""exotic east"" attracted the attentions, and even the affec­

the protege and long-term houseguest of Lady Lucie Duff­

married the prime minister's cousin, Alexander Duff-Gordon, a 
gentleman usher to the queen [Frank 1994]. Although only 
about 10 years older, she took a maternal attitude toward him. She claimed to have educated Azimullah in British culture and 
politics, falsely believing she had convinced him to adopt pro­
British sentiments. She wrote to a friend, Lord Landsdowne: 
I have got my Musselman friend Khan living here, and he quite 
provokes me by his delight at the beauty of the snow ... You wd be 
amused at the incessant questioning that goes on - I have gone through 
such a course of political economy & all social sciences day after day 
& had to get so many books for my pupil to devour that I feel growing 
quite solemn & pedantic. [Azimullah) who came over with a strong 
dislike to the English has become an enthusiatic Englishman & will go 
home with very reforming notions to his own people [ for her letters see 
Frank 1994). Even after his return to India, she signed her letters to him 
""your affect. Mother"", and he addressed her as ""European 
Mother"" in reply. Additionally, Azimullah made himself popular with nubile 
British women. He reportedly cantred with great panache on the 
Brighton Downs, surrounded by a crowd of adoring horse­
women. In particular, he developed an intimate relationship 
with one of them; to protect her reputation, British commenta­
tors referred to her as 'Miss A'. After Azimullah's return to India,

she reportedly wrote adoring letters, partly in French, express­

Azimullah, Lang responded ""Prince indeed! He has changed my 
plate 50 times in India [i e, as a table-servant]"" [Keene 1897, p 162n]. Nonetheless, the generally warm social reception received by 
Azimullah from British women contrasted with the cold official 
one his mission faced. He and Mohammed Ali Khan submitted 
Dhundu Pant' s documents, which the East India Company 
directors rejected and refused to discuss with them. Frustrated 
in their diplomacy in Britain, they left for home injune 1855. Significantly, they deliberately travelled via the trenches of the 
Crimean war (1853-56) where they personally observed the 
British army ineffectively fighting the Russians; this war demon­
strated to them that the British were not invincible [Russell 
1860, Val 1, pp 165-67]. Many other Indian men met similar receptions in Britain. They received honoured receptions by some Britons - including 
British aristocrats and especially aristocratic women - who 
projected onto them Orientalist fantasies and received them as 
royalty in London's salons. While these fantasies were not 
accurate, they nonetheless often proved flattering and socially

British men with experience in the colonies where racial preju­

more dangerous than they appeared to be in India, as a threat

the names of people of rank very freely, which, combined 
with the tone of his remarks induced me to regard him with 
suspicion, mingled, I confess, with dislike"" [Russell 1860, Vol 1, 
pp 165-67]. THE EFFECTS OF 1857 When word of the 1857 conflict reached Indians in Britain, 
virtually all recognised that they had to make a visible choice, 
whatever their private sentiments. Most of those supportive of 
the insurrection dared not express that in the face of an almost 
uniformly hostile British society. Some publicly professed their 
loyalty to Britain and opposition to the ""mutineers"", hoping to 
use this crisis to their own political or personal advantage, or at 
least to mitigate its disadvantages. Of those who returned to 
India, some faced accusations of treason, arrest and interroga­
tion by British authorities. Indeed, some of the most prominent 
who fought against the British in India had been embittered by 
prejudice and injustice that they personally experienced during 
their own time in Britain. Typically, Azimullah, Mohammed Ali 
Khan and Rango Bapojee all evidently fought the British in 
1857. Mohammed Ali Khan and Bapojee's son were summarily 
executed without trial. Despite the £ 50 reward that the British 
put on Bapojee's head and the extensive British manhunt for 
Azimullah, they evaded capture and disappeared. Thus, long 
experience in Britain raised these men's awareness of colonial­
ism and sense of patriotism for India. Further, the sporadically arriving news of the outbreak of the 
1857 fighting destroyed most remaining public or official sym­
pathy for all Indian diplomats currently there. Nevertheless, 
several missions persisted. To have any hope of success, how­
ever, they had now additionally to protest their loyalty to the

several missions persisted. To have any hope of success, how­
ever, they had now additionally to protest their loyalty to the 
British. For example, the ambassadors from Awadh sent a 
petition to the House of Lords in which they expressed their 
"" ... sincere regret [at) the tidings which have reached the British 
kingdom of disaffection prevailing among native troops in
Multiple Meanings of 1857 for Indians in Britain 93 
India"". They assured the British government that they them­
selves were ""a Royal race, ever faithful and true to their 
friendship with the British nation"" [Great Britain, Parliament 
1858, House of Lords debate August 6, 1858, series 3, vol 147, 
pp 1119-22; Times, August 8, 1857]. Nevertheless, the Lords 
rejected their petition on a technicality, since it omitted the 
required term ""Humble"" in places where protocol repeatedly 
demanded it. Even the petition's sponsor, Lord Campbell, 
excused himself for having submitted it, which he said he did out 
of duty alone. Then, in November 1857, the Awadh delegation 
unrealistically offered to reconquer and rule India for queen 
Victoria: ""We propose that the Prince Mirza Md Hamid Allie 
Bahadur Heir Apparent to the King of Oude now resident in 
England should immediately proceed to India supported by a 
British Force and in the name of the King of Oude should 
assume the government of the Country and call upon the People 
to rally round the Standard of the Sovereign against the revolted 
Sepoys"" (letter October 28, 1857, Political Department Home 
Correspondence; Minutes of the Court of Directors November­
December 1857). They cited the precedent of Dost Muhammad, 
ruler of Afghanistan, whom the British had once imprisoned in 
Calcutta but who was supporting them in 1857. This proposal 
met no encouragement from the British. Other Indian diplomats in London had to adopt the same 
position of protesting loyalty to a dis believing British public. For 
instance, Mehdi Ali Khan Bahadur of Rampur, who had gone 
to London in 1856 in order to gain the title and estate of his late 
father-in-law, the Nawab, initially proved able to obtain the 
support of members of Parliament. News of the events of 1857,

departure for home which was solely on the basis of his 
""health"" (Minutes of the Court of Directors October 16, 1857 to 
April 14, 1858). Indeed, the British government and directors increasingly 
pressurised other Indian diplomatic delegations to leave. They 
instructed Ali Morad of Sindh to abandon his campaign for 
restored sovereignty and go ""manifest your zeal and fidelity in
94 
785Z· Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
the service of the British government"" back in India (August 19, 
1857, Political Department Home Correspondence). Likewise, 
Syed Uckbur Ally and KhiratAli Khan Bangash ofjodhpur had 
been in London since 1851 representing Raja Tuckt Singh. In 
September 1857, they submitted petitions to the Company's 
directors and to the House of Commons which proclaimed: ""the 
devoted friendship and zeal displayed by the Prince my master 
upon the breaking out of the deplorable occurrences that now 
convulse the portions of India contingent to his possessions and 
the promptitude with which ( as I learn from the public press) he

British [Minutes of the Court of Directors, East India Company, 
British Library April 9, 1857 to October 14, 1857]. As some Indians, including diplomats and their attendants, 
left London for India, however, they became the focus of 
widespread suspicion by Britons there. For example, on their

111,"As some Indians, including diplomats and their attendants, 
left London for India, however, they became the focus of 
widespread suspicion by Britons there. For example, on their 
arrival in Bombay, thejodhpur ambassadors, their servants and 
their English attorney were all arrested on charges of treason. The British ship captain testified against them: 
the Mahommedan secretary [Khirat Ali Khan Bangash ofJodhpur], in 
my presence and in the presence of the passengers, said that he could 
murder [Governor-General] Lord Dalhousie without remorse, and 
throw his body to the vultures, or something to that effect ... He 
frequently expressed his sympathy with the rebels and mutineers, and 
expressed his wishes for their success. He frequently stated that the 
country would be much better governed under native princes and 
rulers than by the English [Great Britain, Parliament 1859, (Sessionals) 
Commons, Vol 18, p 73, No 125, Return March 4, 1859]. The ship captain added for good measure that one of their 
servants, Mirjan, had immorally abandoned his English wife 
back in London. Not all who came to Britain turned against them in 1857. General Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal had come to Britain in 
1850 where he was treated royally.3 As his British hosts hoped, 
he was impressed by the display of British military and industrial 
power. In 1857, he proved among the staunchest political and 
military supporters of the British. Overall, the sudden and shocking news of the events in 1857 
particularly focused and hardened British attitudes against
Multiple Meanings of 7857 for Indians in Britain 95 
Indian men in more powerful ways than ever before. Lurid 
rumours and reports flooded London about atrocities by Indian 
sepoys and servants against British women and children, includ­
ing mass rapes and murders, which highlighted gendered differ­
ences of racial identity and led to a British national hysteria. Most Britons suddenly saw all Indian males as dangerous, 
particularly to white women. Indian men's hitherto relatively 
easy relationships in Britain with British women of their own 
economic class now became seen by many Britons as charged 
with racial and sexual transgression. Indian women, in India, 
did not apparently draw as much hostile attention despite the 
prominence of the Begum Hazrat Mahal of Awadh and Rani 
Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi, these women either appearing as roman­
tic heroines or masculinised warriors. Nor did the British press 
comment on the sexual violations of Indian women by British 
soldiers. Rather, most of the alleged atrocities involved male 
protagonists with British women as subjects, either of 
molestation by Indian men or revenge by British men. Only a few Britons dared express toleration, saying Indians, 
especially men they had known, could not be as bad as news and 
rumours portrayed.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=111

alleged participation in the Kanpur ""massacre"" of British prison­
ers by Nana Sahib reached her, his patron and nominal ""mother"", 
Lady Duff-Gordon, wrote: 
I am quite unable to believe that [Azimullah] could approve or endure 
the atrocious conduct...[but] I am singular .. .in giving ... my sympathy to 
the natives who are between two millstones - first tyrannised by the 
sepoys ... and then harried by the English ... The English victims at least 
will have vengeance and subscriptions, but who will pity the poor, 
helpless mass of people guilty of the offence of a dark skin and a 
religion of their own? What a vista of disaster & hatred is before us and 
them! [quoted in Frank 1994-, pp 190-91 ]. Even distinctively sympathetic Britons came to regard 
all Indian men with suspicion and a sense of betrayal. Many 
Britons expected their Indian acquaintances to ""prove"" 
their trustworthiness by speaking or acting against the ""mutineers"". Even working-class Indians in London encountered the 
sudden opprobrium of appearing to be a ""hostile"". For ex­
ample, a Bengali ·named Joaleeka had come to London with
96

Prince Gholam Mohamed, youngest son of Tipu Sultan, in 1854. Rather than return to India with his employer,Joaleeka stayed 
on in London, living with a series of English and Irish women, 
fathering at least five children with them, and nominally convert­
ing to Christianity (although, he reportedly said, ""so I turned 
Christian. I do not know what it means, but I am a Christian, and 
have been for many years"" [quoted in Halliday 1862, p 4241). Despite having thus settled in London for years, earning by 
interpreting for other Indians, begging from Britons, and doing 
odd jobs, British attitudes toward him radically changed during 
the fighting of 1857: ""After the mutiny .. .I did very badly. No one

that knew me used to chaff me about it, and call me Johnny 
Sepoy"" [quoted in Halliday 1862, p 425]. At the same time, London journals like The City Mission 
Magazine (August 1857) articulated British fears about promis­
cuous intercourse between Asian men and British women, 
especially the community of the Oriental Quarter: 
Men of all colours, and half a score of nations, are accompanied by a 
host of [White] women. Many are drunk, and all are riotous; the women 
have sailors' hats on their heads, and sailors' belts round their waists; 
they are quarrelling and pulling each other about; some have been 
robbed, and the police are amongst them; the language uttered is such 
as Satan only could suggest, and the whole scene calls up in the mind 
of the spectator an idea of the orgies of hell [cited in Salter 1873, p 34). Thus, Indian men of all classes in Britain faced even more 
difficulties during 1857. Even more so in India, British men raged to revenge the 
alleged atrocities perpetrated by Indian men against British 
women. Azimullah was particularly singled out for opprobrium. Many British authors condemned Azimullah in particular for his 
relations with British women. Lord Frederick Roberts wrote in 
December 1857 with shock and horror on finding letters 
from ""that fiend Azimula Khan ... Such rubbish I never read, 
partly in French, which this scoundrel seems to have under­
stood; how English ladies can be so infatuated. Miss ... was going 
to marry Azimula, and I have no doubt would like to still, 
altho' he was the chief instigator in the Cawnpore massacres"" 
[Roberts 1924, pp 120-21]. Later British commentators on 1857 
repeated these aspersions, calling Azimullah ""an accomplished
Multiple Meanings of 1857 for Indians in Britain 97

had attracted British women ""like moths in candlelight, they will 
fly and get burned"" [Keene 1883, p 69].",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=113

of this Mahommedan polygamist... Then let us point the 
moral, by warning Belgravia to be careful ere she adorns the

intimate relations with an Indian man emerged as one of 
the most powerful tropes among British writers during and 
after 1857. AITERMATHS OF 1857 After the immediate crisis of 1857 ended, British attitudes 
toward Indians in Britain softened somewhat but did not 
completely revert to earlier modes. Subsequent British stereo­
types largely rendered all ""Indians"" as unalterably alien, rein­
forced as these stereotypes were by popular understandings of 
Darwinian biological inheritance, pseudo-scientific social Dar­
winism, and the ""race""-based conflicts in 1865 inJamaica and 
the Maori wars lasting until 1872 in New Zealand. Yet, the British 
raj policies favouring Indian princes as the ""natural leaders"" of 
India actually gained them more access to the British queen and 
more favourable policies from the British government. Hence, 
the later lives of Indians remaining or newly arrived in Britain 
continued to be affected by the reverberations of 1857. One particularly salient theme in the changes caused by 1857 
was that of gender relations between Britons and Indians. As we 
have seen, even before 1857, many Britons had already began 
to regard the Oriental Quarter as an alien presence in the 
imperial capital. Social reformers and religious evangelicals 
particularly found its mixing of Indian and British cultures, 
peoples, and bodies to be a threat to British morality. In 1873, 
missionary Salter castigated the shift in London's Oriental 
Quarter of an English public house, the Royal Sovereign 
(12 Blue Gate Fields), into a haven for lascars and British lower­
class women:",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=114

taken possession of it, and twenty beds are spread out for the repose 
of the Lascars who seek shelter [in the skittle-ground]. The jagree dust, 
crazy hookas, and dirty Iotas give evidence of the free use made of it. But, hark! what is that uproarious shout of discordant Asiatic and 
European voices mingled? - the sound of excited men and women 
together. .. only a jollification and a spree these Lascars have with the 
[British] ladies of the neighbourhood ... [Salter 1873, pp 31-32, 69]. This house was still owned by a British man in 1873, but a 
Goan Indian, Francis Kaudery, operated it, to Salter's dismay. British popular authors also represented these changed 
gender attitudes. Prior to 1857, for example, Sir Walter Scott's 
The Surgeon's Daughter (1830), was perhaps the only popular 
book suggesting Indian male desire for British womanhood 
(and that novel highlighted a traitorous Scottish procurer of a 
Scottish virgin for the notorious Tipu Sultan). During and 
subsequent to 1857, however, such British fictional accounts of 
Indian men pursuing or assaulting British women, as well as 
""Mutiny"" literature generally, became a virtual genre, continu­
ing to today. Thus, the events of 1857 made white British 
womanhood into the symbol of British purity that needed 
protection and created British public and official hostility 
against Indian men in Britain as well as India. Quite differently, later Indian and Pakistani historians 
have also highlighted some of the Indians who had returned 
from Britain to oppose the British during 1857 in India but 
rather as nationalist freedom fighting heroes. Basu argues

their last grandure [sic] from the jaws of the great colonial 
power. This was the master brain of Azimullah Khan, a great

these men's direct experiences of life in Britain made them 
particularly aware of the global scope and force of British 
colonialism [c f, Bayly 1998]. Following the crisis of 1857, Indians in Britain of various 
classes managed to manoeuvre through these changed British 
attitudes toward non-whites. Indian royalty, including Dalip 
Singh, and two descendants of the nawab of the Carnatic, Hafiz 
Lodroo Islam Khan and Hyder Jung remained in Britain and 
eventually regained British favour as did others. Former maha­
raja Gholam Mahomed of Coorg spent 1857 in India but, once 
the fighting was over, he returned to London with his son and 
grandson, receiving increased pensions and benefits and 
savouring London's high society. Overall, the Indian princes 
who did not egregiously oppose the British emerged thereafter 
as princely pillars of raj and were often welcome in London. Also in Britain during the crisis were middle-class Indians 
including Parsi scholar and merchant from Bombay, Dadabhai 
Naoroji, the second Indian elected to the British parliament and 
the 'Grand Old Man' of the Indian National Congress. Indeed, 
many later Indian nationalists also studied in Britain during 
subsequent decades, learning there about the larger patterns of 
British colonialism; some became nationalist political leaders 
including B R Ambedkar, S C Bose, Mohandas Gandhi, 
Aurobindo Ghose, M A Jinnah, Jawaharlal Nehru, and 
VD Savarkar. As has been extensively studied, all these men 
found their experiences in high colonial Britain helped them 
formulate their own political and cultural nationalisms.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=116

- also engaged critically with British society, opposing British 
efforts to control their lives and impressions. Nor did all Indians 
respond the same way. Some, including Sir Mancherjee 
Merwanjee Bhownaggree, MP, remained staunch Tories. The events of 1857 thus marked a transition in the experi­
ences oflndians in Britain as many among them tended to bond 
with each other in the face of increasingly hostile British 
imperialism and racism against them collectively. Yet, 1857 was 
not an absolutely abrupt transformation. There had been pre­
cursors of these changes in both Indian and British attitudes. Many Indians there had developed a sense of class solidarity,
100

living as many did in the community of the Oriental Quarter or 
the social centres provided by Indian diplomatic delegations. Further, the perspective from Britain provided some of them 
with the distance to recognise the larger patterns of global 
colonialism, something more difficult to do from India. Overall, 
a sense of themselves as collectively Indian and an early 
patriotism developed among many despite their origins in 
different regions and/or religious communities. British prejudi­
cial stereotypes were not uniform nor did they apply equally to 
all classes of Indians. During and after 1857, gender relations 
between Indian men and British women particularly changed, 
reflecting complex and changing patterns. Thus, the events of 
1857 marked a particularly powerful moment in the larger shift 
in the lives of Indians in Britain, especially Indian men. Subse­

New Lamps for Old 
Colonial Experiments with Vernacular 
Education, Pre- and Post-1857 Anu Kumar 
EARLY education policy was amorphous; the company men 
were mainly traders, while their Indian subordinates rendered 
vital assistance in matters of administration. There are no 
sustained accounts available of the trajectory of education in 
19th century India, especially in its phase of transition and as 
merchant capitalism gave way to imperialism. In the late 18th 
century, from the details available in Calcutta, indigenous 
schools of elementary ('pathshalas') and higher learning, where 
education was imparted in Bengali, Sanskrit, and also in Arabic 
and Persian, existed along with largely missionary-run English 
schools. It was left to Calcutta's elite to organise and reform the 
pathshalas. This began with the setting up of the Calcutta Book 
SoGiety and Calcutta School Society in 1817 and 1818, respec­
tively [Acharya 1990]. These societies brought various schools 
under its purview and also introduced printed textbooks and 
new subjects like geography. They arranged for training of 
the teachers and set up five model pathshalas. These societies 
sought to improve the quality of education without changing its 
indigenous character. Of the 78,500 books printed by the 
Calcutta Book Society, between 1817 and 1821, 48,750 were in 
Bengali and only 3,500 were in English (ibid). The rest were in 
Persian, Hindustani, Sanskrit, etc. Bengali was the main medium 
of instruction and sometimes the only language taught (ibid). By the late 18th century, English pathshalas had mushroomed 
in Calcutta to meet the needs of indigent English-speaking 
people. The first Bengali-run English school in Calcutta was set
104 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week01 
up in 177 4 where students were charged Rs 4-16 depending on 
their means. More and more schools came up, for Indians as 
well as Anglo Indians sometimes introducing new subjects and 
new methods of teaching [Acharya 1990; Mazumdar 1996]. In its inital stages, English education in India was always a 
two-way process. David Hare was instrumental for the Calcutta 
School Society's model schools, especially the Arpuly school, 
and did much to influence their later growth. To meet the 
increasing demand for English education, parallel English 
classes were begun; but to guard against the neglect of vernacu­
lar studies, only students proficient in Bengali were granted 
admission to the English classes and later of receiving higher 
English education atthe society's expense. During Ishwarchanflra

121,"David Hare was instrumental for the Calcutta 
School Society's model schools, especially the Arpuly school, 
and did much to influence their later growth. To meet the 
increasing demand for English education, parallel English 
classes were begun; but to guard against the neglect of vernacu­
lar studies, only students proficient in Bengali were granted 
admission to the English classes and later of receiving higher 
English education atthe society's expense. During Ishwarchanflra 
Vidyasagar's tenure as the principal of Sanskrit College (1851-
58), a condensed course in Sanskrit was introduced along with 
some exposure to English language and literature (Acharya). Thus, a balance was sought between the claims of English and 
vernacular education. Other schools such as this came up, in the 
so-called Anglo vernacular model. The T atwabodhini Pathshala 
was set up by Debendranath Tagore (Rabindranath's father) in 
1840; his aim was to develop it into a model ""national school"". But this, as would be seen for most schools in the Anglo 
vernacular tradition, did not survive. Debendranath's school 
was abolished in 1848. The reason was the big demand for 
English education, chiefly for the purposes of serving the 
colonial bureaucracy. By 1830, Alexander Duff had already 
opened his General Assembly's Institution, where English was 
the only medium of instruction, with five pupils. Its swift success 
was a victory for Duffs zealous support for English education 
and paved the way for Macaulay and his by now famous minute 
of 1835. From the towns, this trend only spread to other 
provinces following the sway of colonial rule. COLONIAL EDUCATION POLICY The colonial education policy could arguably be said to have 
begun with the observation made in 1792 by Charles Grant, 
adviser to Cornwallis, then governor general. Grant advocated 
spreading the light of European knowledge through the 
medium of the English language. Macaulay's notions, coming
New Lamps for Old 105 
some three decades later, derived much from Charles Grant. Up to the 1830s no uniform system of education existed. The 
function of the general committee of public instruction formed 
in 1823 was confined to funding and supervising government 
institutions. The general committee for its part was sharply 
divided into two groups 
the Anglicists (who believed in the 
superiority of English and European knowledge) and the 
orientalists (who were keener on restoring and rejuvenating 
ancient knowledge and languages of the orient). But neither 
showed any concern for vernacular education - even the 
orientalists chiefly favoured Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian. A report in 1822 of the proceedings of the parliamentary 
committee reveals the British government's anxiety to resolve 
this crisis over education policy. A majority in the committee 
was in favour of English education, with only James Mill 
recommending the translation of European books into Indian 
languages. The majority opinion prevailed and Macaulay was 
made the president of the general committee in 1834.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=121

recommending the translation of European books into Indian 
languages. The majority opinion prevailed and Macaulay was 
made the president of the general committee in 1834. His 
historic minute was issued on February 2, 1835. A decade before this, in 1823, the general committee for 
public instruction had asked the local committees in Agra, 
Delhi and other north Indian towns to report on the condition 
of education within their province and to propose measures to 
raise standards. For Delhi, the picture was dismal. Although 
there were some madrasas, as the foundation and endowment 
of educ.ational institutions was perceived as a good deed by 
pious Muslims, the number of students was small, as compared 
to the city's inhabitants. Attendance was tardy and quality of 
teaching was poor. The government sanctioned a grant of Rs 
600 per month ""for the instruction of Muhammadan youth"" in 
Delhi and thus, the Delhi College began its existence. It 
commenced teaching in the Ghaziu'd-Din madrasa barely two 
years later [Pernau 2006]. Macaulay's minute of 1835 that enshrined English as the 
principle medium for effecting the progressive ""westernisation"" 
of ""Indian"" cultures and subjectivities and Charles Wood's 
despatch of 1854 are generally held as the two major milestones 
of colonial educational policy. Wood's despatch stressed the 
educational responsibility of the state and envisioned a com­
plete and integrated system comprising primary, secondary and
106 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
collegiate education. Oriental literature, it proposed, should not 
be neglected but European language should be cultivated. English should be the medium of higher studies for the few and 
the vernacular at a lower level for the many. Wood's despatch 
and subsequent state directives on educational policy urged the 
restriction of state investment to higher education and the upper 
classes (classes that upheld British interests) for they would 
purportedly disseminate ""European knowledge"" to the masses. Such a differential construction of the curriculum at the school 
and university level has been described as ""functionalist"" [Gauri 
Vishwanathan cited in Goswami 2004]. A system of ""grants-in­
aid"" was also proposed to encourage vernacular education. English medium instruction was the exclusive provenance of 
the first universities established in 1857. The universities estab­
lished were based on the model of London University - not in 
teaching but examining and conferring degrees 
and also for 
affiliated colleges of different kinds (ibid). The entrance exami­
nation and college teaching were conducted in English.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=122

colleges, the vernacular soon came to be excluded from the first 
arts (FA) and BA courses in 1864. The Hindu College set the 
pattern in this respect. English not only had pride of place in the 
curriculum but overshadowed every other subject. A process of downward filtration extended this English bias 
to school education as well, in spite of Wood's despatch. The 
model pathshalas of the Calcutta School Society for instance, 
became model primary schools - a component of the uniform 
system 
where education was imparted in English as it was 
envisaged by the government. Like the indigenous elementary 
schools, vernacular missionary schools also turned into English 
schools or died away. The Bengal Auxiliary Missionary Society 
gave the reason when it discontinued every vernacular society 
school, except one in Krishnapur - ""the desire to obtain 
knowledge of the English language has been so great that a 
school in which this was not taught was sure to dwindle away"" 
[Acharya 1990]. This article is a preliminary examination that looks at two 
institutions in the vernacular medium in Delhi and the North 
West Provinces (NWP) that had their beginnings in the early 
stages of the colonial encounter. It was a time when experimen­
tation was new and coexisted with the urge to understand, but

experiments such as these had an untimely end, hastened 
arguably by the events of 1857 that led to a shift of priorities and 
the changing imperatives of empire. SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT ON EDUCATION In the NWP, educational policies were also influenced by the 
crisis of the Indian political system, brought on by the gradual, 
at times sudden, changes in society and economy. In the early 19th century, the intermediate economy still 
flourished. As Chris Bayly (1998) explains, the company's 
revenue policy was relatively indulgent to the notables in the 
NWP whose pomp and display helped generate employment 
and sustain an intermediate economy based on military, artisan 
and transport services. From the 1830s a disruption set in of 
demand at both luxury and intermediate levels of the economy. The result of a complex set of changes were: 
(i) The Gangetic area and the western areas suffered a 
depression deriving from the problems of liquidity. The acreage 
under cash crops, especially indigo, had been at artificially high 
levels for this served as a channel of remittance for Indian profits 
and salaries to Britain.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=123

affected the export sector and internal trade also. (ii) British standardisation of the economy affected the local 
taxation, local mints and ""idle consumption"" that had been the 
hallmark of the small kingdoms and principalities besides 
enticing away the mercantile capital that supported them. (iii) Between 1803 and 1830, there was also a substantial 
increase in the real revenue collected that reduced the dispos­
able income of the rich zamindars and cut off the large varid. J:y 
of perquisites, which actually sustained the artisan economy 
[Bayly 1998]. (iv) The anti-talukdar settlements of Thomason and Bird also 
deprived the little kings of the locality of a large proportion of 
their revenue-engaging rights and put in their stead a variety of 
village magnates who were perceived as ""ancient owners of the 
soil"". The settlements (as Charles Metcalfe cited in Bayly (1998), 
p 264 says) did substantially alter the social map of the Gangetic 
valley and its western tracts. The landlords and large owners of
108 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
Agra, Etawah and Mainpuri districts were permanently weak­
ened. Over a period of 20 years, many notables spent large sums 
in fighting law suits. Some permanently lost a large part of their 
income. Besides the increase in revenue, a large number of old 
princely families {in Benares and Farukkabad) were pensioned 
off on allowances or fixed stipends. Within a generation, they 
had been minutely subdivided, among numerous descendants. By the 1830s, most of the government pensions were paid 
directly to mercantile creditors of the landed aristocracy. In the 
short run no prosperous or viable village landlord element 
emerged to fill the landlords' local economic and social role (ibid). Eighteen Fiftyseven then appears to have been a belated

encounter between British and Indo-Muslim culture through 
the medium of Urdu. In the first half of the 19th century, there 
were already attempts in several madrassas in Delhi to reinter­
pret classical received knowledge and traditions. Endeavours to 
translate knowledge into a medium meaningful for the new 
circumstances had begun well before the British established 
their political and cultural supremacy over north India in the 
early 19th century. The college contributed to the development of Urdu prose, 
was a nursery of science teaching, and served as a catalyst for 
major works on scientific subjects. Through its vernacular 
translation society, it mediated between eastern and western 
cultures, contributing to building an Urdu-speaking and reading 
public from different religious persuasions [Pernau 2006]. With 
its changes in the traditional academic curriculum, it also 
fostered a climate of liberal thought and the rational spirit. The move to support the Delhi College, that came about in 
1825 following the report of the general committee was a 
traditional gesture of patronage. But within a decade, this was 
translated into an altogether different idiom. In 1828, the English
New Lamps for Old 109 
branch of the Delhi College commenced with a new course of 
study in English language, literature and modern European 
sciences. It offered a space where ambitious Indian students to 
""anglicise"" in pursuit of advancement through service to the 
British. The older oriental branch continued to exist in which 
Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit were taught along with geography, 
mathematics and the sciences. The setting up of the Delhi English College took place in the 
context of a new understanding- the British were trying to make 
sense of the country they had conquered and its culture. On the 
other hand, the conquered hoped to reinterpret the new learn­
ing in their own language and cultural framework. Translation 
stood at the centre of the Delhi College's activities - most 
obviously in the Vernacular Translation Society. ""The transla­
tions of the Delhi College translators show their cultural assump­
tions, their selections and choices and their reinterpretation of 
the British texts they imported into the Urdu language they too 
did have an agenda of change, which they wanted to induce 
through translation"" [ibid, p 18].",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=125

the science teacher and Maulvi Zakaullah, the historian and 
textbook writer, fearlessly set out to discover new knowledge 
and in the process, hoped to rejuvenate their own culture, 
guided and helped by a colonial power that in the beginning at 
least, was not yet intent on replacing oriental languages with 
English. Margrit Pernau cites successive reports of the Delhi Gazette 
(D G) to bring this out. On April 25, 1838 the D G wrote that 
unlike in Bengal, in Delhi the debate on ""native education"" did 
not oppose the defenders of oriental and western knowledge so 
much as those who wanted to transmit the values of the west 
through English and those who claimed that the ""paramount 
object (should be) to make the improvement and cultivation of 
the vernacular tongue go hand in hand with the promulgation 
of the thoughts and ideas, the solidity of reasoning and freedom 
of enquiry of the European world"". Teaching through Urdu, the 
argument ran, offered the possibility of impacting the Indian 
mind to an extent (and at a price!) which English could not even 
begin to. It was not an appreciation for the beauty of the Urdu 
language and patronage for oriental learning that stood at the 
centre of the reform of Delhi College, but the belief that by

introducing them into the schools, they would ""gradually set the

changing role of the British themselves, as they moved from

imperatives of the new era manifested themselves. As a member of the committee of public instruction, Charles 
Trevelyan strongly advocated in 1834, the abandonment of 
Persian language education and also the mandatory use of the 
Roman alphabet for all Indian languages. He stood as the 
central supporter in the overall drive for Anglicisation, that most 
starkly manifested itself in Macaulay's famous minute, only a 
year later. From the 1830s members of the Delhi College 
committee headed by the same Charles Trevelyan also argued 
strenuously that only inter-communal education from ""the pure 
fount of English 
literature"" would enable India to make 
""headway against the impenetrable barrier of habit and preju­
dice backed by religious feeling"" [Fisher 2006]. The Delhi College's English courses initiated in 1828 on an 
experimental basis, struggled for educational material and other 
resources in its first years. The English courses had begun with 
""a few old fashioned English spelling books with difficulty 
procured from the neighbouring British stations"". But the col­
lege committee's grand plan began with the elite of Delhi and 
hoped to effect the complete uplift and reformation of the 
""uneducated and half-barbarous people"" of India generally. This plan once effected would form the basis of an India-wide 
new model educational system of preparatory schools in every 
district and a network of regional colleges. The committee 
envisioned [ibid 2006]: Christian, Mohammedan and Hindu boys of every shade of colour, 
and variety of descent...standing side by side in the same class, engaged 
in the common pursuit of English literature, contending for the same 
honours, and forced to acknowledge the existence of superior merit in 
their comrades of the lowest as well as in those of the highest caste. This

character on them, and to leave the yielding and affectionate mind of 
youth to its natural impulse. Habits of friendly communication will thus 
be established between all classes, they will insensibly become one 
people, and the process of enlightening our subjects will proceed 
simultaneously, with that of uniting them among themselves (Statement 
made in 1828 by Charles Trevelyan cited in Hasan 2006). The college committee thus diverted funds from a Rs 1,70,000 
endowment given by N awab E'timadu' d-Daula of Awadh against 
the repeated protests of its donor who desired its use for 
traditional Persian and Arabic study. This money enabled the 
Delhi College to expand the experimental courses in English 
""for the formation of a separate institution on an enlarged scale, 
devoted to affording tuition in the English language, sciences 
and literature"". It now became known as the Delhi Institute or 
the Delhi English Institution. Politically too, the situation was 
changing. As the British population, notably the army, increased 
in Delhi, they were no longer willing or able to integrate with the 
local population. The less they thought they had to learn from 
the orient, the more, however, the colonial officers found to 
teach [Dalrymple 2006]. The abolition of Persian as the official 
language of British rule in 1837 was followed by the decision of 
the Delhi residency to henceforth accept letters and petitions 
from their Indian allies only in English. Transformed power relations permitted the colonial power to 
give way to new sensibilities and policies. ""In the Delhi territory, 
rule by alliances was now replaced by rule by records - the 
supporters, the British now needed, were no longer the com­
manders of detachments of horses but those able to wield the 
pen in their service, no longer nobles, but members of middling 
groups who hoped to gain social status by serving the British"" 
[Pernau ,2006]. All this had an impact on the continued meta­
morphosis seen in the English branch of the Delhi College.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=128

[Pernau ,2006]. All this had an impact on the continued meta­
morphosis seen in the English branch of the Delhi College. In 1842, the two branches of the college, the English and the 
oriental moved under the same roof, in the former residence of 
the British resident and once the library of Dara Shikoh. At the 
same time, the curricula of the two branches were integrated, the 
emphasis being on ""useful knowledge"" - natural sciences, 
mathematics, natural philosophy, economics, morals and history. 112 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly The medium of instruction would be English at the Delhi 
Institute and Urdu at the Delhi College, which at the same time 
would continue the teaching of the classical Arabic and 
Persian books. In the Persian and Arabic classes, the stress was on mastering 
the languages, law and the principles of jurisprudence and a bit 
of philosophy and logic. The classical books were after a while 
replaced by works of literature such as Arabian Nights and the 
Kalila Dimna, a development that struck at the heart of the 
traditional concept of knowledge. Though much of the old 
curriculum was retained, the orientation towards religion and 
the intimate link that held the different fields of knowledge 
together was broken. It was a move that coincided with the 
religious disputations then taking place between adherents of 
different reformist Muslim schools of thought in Delhi 
[Hasan 2006]. At the oriental branch, however, translation and adaptation 
work of books in English continued. The list of books translated 
included algebra, geometry to revenue laws and MaNaughten's 
principles of Islamic criminal law, from English history to 
Smith's Moral Sentiments and from books on hydraulics to 
treatises on polarisation of light, a total of almost 130 books in 
the short span of 15 years between the reform of the college and 
the outbreak of the revolt (ibid). The alumni of the branch were trained to become translators, 
whose familiarity with both cultures meant they would ""use their 
knowledge of western scholarship to rethink and transform the 
canonic knowledge of the east and thus bring together both 
worlds"". But it was a skewed process.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=129

curricula and focus) from 1835 onwards, Hindus always consti­
tuted about two-thirds of the student population, whereas the 
original aim in 1825 had been to assist Muhammedan youth in 
their education. It appears probable that the college was 
frequented more by those who profited from the upheaval 
brought about by the colonial power and for whom a career in 
the British service provided a means to upward social mobility. In 1854, it had 333 students, of whom 112 were Muslims. More than the elite of Delhi, the college relied on 
colonial funding and patronage to survive. In the standards of 
the traditional learned circles of Delhi, and even with regard to
New Lamps for Old 113 
the other north Indian colleges, the Delhi College did not 
compare favourably and James Thomason as lieutenant gover­
nor of the NWP had to fight a hard battle with the committee for 
public instruction in Calcutta in order to have examination 
standards for scholarships lowered for Delhi and Agra for no 
student would then have a chance to secure a scholarship. In 1857, when the revolt reached Delhi in May, the college 
was attacked, its rich collection of manuscripts burnt down, and 
the principal was killed. A revival occurred in 1864 and lasted 
till 1877 but it was short-lived. Suspicions between the new 
rulers and Delhi's old, largely Muslim elite, were too deep now 
to be ever bridged. The impact of the new learning engendered 
by the Delhi College was also short-lived and in the long run, 
much less far-reaching. Although the college blazed a trail in

Allan Octavian (AO) Hume's experiments in vernacular 
education were preceded by the pioneering initiatives taken by 
James Thomason when the latter was the governor of NWP 
(1843-53). In 1849, the modern vernacular educational system 
began with funding the creation of 'tahsili' schools in eight
114 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
districts of the north-west provinces that included Etawah. Thomason also supported the creation of modern village pri­
mary schools, where teaching was provided in the vernaculars 
and funded by voluntary tax contributions of local zamindars. Such schools began haltingly in Mathura in 1851 and in 1853, in 
Mainpuri and Etawah. These village primary schools were 
organised to serve groups of several villages and were called 
'halkabandi schools'. In early 1856, when AO Hume became district magistrate for 
Etawah, the educational system was far from satisfactory. With 
an estimated population of over 5,50,000, the district had seven 
government-supported tahsili schools (400 pupils) and 77 tradi­
tional indigenous schools with twice the number of students. The experiment in funding village primary schools (halkabandi 
schools) was evidently failing, as the voluntary funding principle 
was ignored and zamindars were forced to provide contribu­
tions [for details, see Mehrotra and Moulton 2004]. Hume had no complaints against the tahsili schools but his 
attitude towards the indigenous schools where education was 
provided in Arabic and Persian, was decidedly negative. He 
characterised such an education as ""generally most objection­
able"" and complained about the ""lascivious stories"" being 
imparted through Persian or Arabic.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=131

was also the very antithesis of these indigenous schools, and 
Hume was critical of the secretary of state for India for still 
wanting to utilise them. Over these hedge schools and masters, no sort of control can be 
exercised; we cannot prescribe the course of studies in the former, nor 
can we furnish the latter when they are found wanting or permanently 
reward them when they excel. These masters are, too many of them, 
of doubtful character and extreme ignorance ... able to teach most of 
their scholars only an imperfect smattering of Indian Persian or 
execrable Sanskrit, through the medium not infrequently of stories so 
indecent, that no English gentleman can hear him without a blush 
(ibid). Burne's efforts to rejuvenate the vernacular school system 
meant that by early 1856, 32 new vernacular schools had been 
established in Etawah pargana. By the beginning of 1857, a total 
of 181 modern vernacular schools had been established with an 
enrolment of some 5,000 pupils. The foundation of the central
New Lamps for Old 115 
anglo-vernacular school in Etawah was laid in August 1, 1856, 
which was also locally funded and had some 100 scholars by the 
end of the year. Hume organised a scholarship scheme to 
enable 12 scholars, eight from halkabandi, tahsili and indig­
enous schools in the mufassal and four from Etawah town to 
complete their education at the central school. He also estab­
lished a public library. He hoped the libraries would serve the 
needs of the local schools and also help improve the education 
of patwaris. HUME'S METHODS In 1856, Lakshman Singh (the tahsildar serving under Hume) 
led Hume's efforts in persuading the more prominent zamindars 
to support a second attempt towards rejuvenating the halkabandi 
school system. In keeping with the government guidelines, the 
local funding was equivalent to 1 per cent of the amount which 
the zamindars paid annually in land revenue. The involvement 
of Indian leaders in the establishment and management of 
schools was part of the overall promotion of the official plan, 
overseen by Lakshman Singh and Hume.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=132

tion of the patwaris and to enhancing the accuracy and efficient 
maintenance of their records. Hume believed that the welfare of 
the agricultural population depended on the ability and integ­
rity of the patwari, i e, the local officials responsible for records 
relating to landholdings, revenue and rental payments as well as 
for the maintenance of accounts and statistics. The libraries he 
helped establish, Hume hoped, would in turn, enable the 
elevation of the public mind and help advance ""the cause of 
civilisation"" in Etawah. In ensuring the well-being and support 
of the landed proprietors, Hume believed in the comparative 
lightness of the land revenue. Etawah, during the revolt, wit­
nessed two major battles and the district was also close to the 
heart of some of the bitterest fighting in the entire revolt. But 
Hume retained the support of practically all his Indian officials 
and most of the influential zamindars. After hostilities had 
declined, Hume also argued for and made substantial remis­
sions of land revenue. In his reports after the revolt, Hume 
expressed the view that the comparative ""lightness"" of land
116

revenue assessment in Etawah district coupled with the more 
typical Anglo-Indian nostrums for governance, (had) assured 
the people's loyalty to the regime, with the exception ofDalelnagar 
Pargana where landed proprietors were reduced to indebted­
ness partly because of an overassessment of land revenue by the 
raj. ""It is still to our own, mistakes our own want of foresight and 
appreciation of the native character and not to any special 
depravity of the people that the impartial historian will attribute 
the rebellion"" [Hume in Mehrotra and Moulton ibid]. The experience of the rebellion made Hume more certain 
than ever of the urgency of extending and strengthening 
modern education. After all, he surmised, those Indians ex­
posed to British introduced modern education had overwhelm­
ingly supported the government during the disturbances. He 
believed there was a direct connection between Etawah's recent 
""pre-eminent"" development in elementary education and its 
evident loyalty during the rebellion.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=133

posed to British introduced modern education had overwhelm­
ingly supported the government during the disturbances. He 
believed there was a direct connection between Etawah's recent 
""pre-eminent"" development in elementary education and its 
evident loyalty during the rebellion. For Hume, the widespread 
dissemination of modern elementary education attuned to 
the socio-economic needs of an overwhelmingly agrarian 
district not noted for high levels of education:tl or cultural 
attainment, was the key to the,peopJe's and the country's moral 
advancement. Give the rajputs and other fighting men reasonable means and happy 
homes, free from those instruments of torture, the civil courts and the 
native usurer, and they will fight for order and the government under 
whom they are well off. Make it easier for your guijar, ahir and thief 
classes to grow rich by agriculture than crime and besides making 
criminal administration cheaper, most of these for their own sake will 
side with the government. Tax the baniahs, bankers who growing rich 
by the pen, oust their betters from their ancestral holdings, and then are 
too great cowards to wield a sword, either to protect their own 
acquisitions or aid the government that fostered their success (ibid). As the rebellion waned, Hume encountered problems over 
the reimbursement by the government of certain items in the 
district treasury that had been looted during the disturbances. In 
August 1859, the government sanctioned the reimbursement of 
most claims submitted by Hume, but declined to repay funds 
raised by public subscription for education and public libraries. In September 2, Hume expressed his hurt at the government's 
refusal to refund funds first obtained by inviting subscriptions to

the public funds. He believed such funds for elementary schools 
were more vital than colleges. The foundation of any healthy and comprehensive scheme of educa­
tion must be laid amongst the masses, let but the root pierce deeply and 
spread widely through soil judiciously loosened and leaf, flower and 
fruit will burst out and bloom spontaneously in one season. Hitherto

unborn, while I would devote our chief care, our last energies to sowing 
thickly, and widely through the land, good elementary schools for the 
people"" ! Hume, ibid}. Moreover, while he acknowledged the importance of the 
government's role in education, Hume went out of his way to 
emphasise the crucial significance of directly involving an 
Indian popular element in the process. Failure to involve the 
people in the development of modern education had been the 
source, he believed, of the ""misapprehension"" which had 
existed in some places over the government's intentions. Hume's 
concern over the involvement of the popular element also 
influenced his view that taxes, that were to be raised locally for 
new village and town schools, must be voluntary rather than 
compulsory. In his report of September 2, 1859 to the education depart­
ment, Hume outlined his philosophy of education. It was a 
system that provided for three basic categories of schools, 
village, town and central; school buildings needed to be sited in 
good substantial structures. He stressed the importance of 
kindred institutions, namely, public libraries and in the case of 
the central Anglo-vernacular school, a reading room and a 
museum intended primarily to illustrate the botany, natural 
history and industrial products of the province; a printing press 
was also a necessary adjunct to the educational establishment. The 
system of school management was one in which the practical 
control of district schools needed to be vested primarily in the
118

district officer with the education department being responsible 
only for regular inspections designed to ""test progress and see 
that the rules in force"" were observed. Colleges funded by the 
state, controlled by the education department would be estab­
lished in each administrative division.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=135

state, controlled by the education department would be estab­
lished in each administrative division. Training of teachers 
needed to be provided for at each divisional college and 
scholarships to support really clever pupils from the village 
school to the university. Hume noted that as a result of the modern education initia­
tives of 1856, more than 7,000 students had been attending 
schools in May 1857, just prior to the outbreak of the rebellion. He reported in January 1858 that in 31 schools, teachers had 
remained throughout the disturbance at their posts. As regards 
the halkabandi schools, Hume provided figures between num­
bers of institutions, enrolment figures and levels of funding from 
the 1 per cent tax before and after the rebellion. By January 
1859, the system had largely recovered except in student 
registrations which were 4,374 compared with 5,186 two years 
earlier. In the six years since he restarted the halkabandi schools 
in 1856, the people had voluntarily contributed Rs 72,000 in 
school taxes and more than Rs 50,000 in labour, land, materials 
and money, for school buildings, fittings, etc. Post-revolt, Hume devoted great attention on reviving the 
central school that was at the apex of the new education system 
he envisioned for the district. It was a ""stepping stone"" for the 
best students of the halkabandi and tahsili schools to the ""Agra 
College"" and thus designed to put within the reach of every 
talented lad, however poor, the attainment of a first rate 
education. After the rebellion, the management of the school 
was transferred to a local committee (of local residents, elected 
to a certain extent by the parents of the pupils). The committee 
within the first six months of its operation raised the number of 
pupils from 70 to 250. Hume was seeking to introduce a limited 
but practical measure of self-government in the area of educa­
tion and hoped thereby to strengthen support for modern 
elementary education within the Indian community.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=136

in English, Urdu, Hindi, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, mathematics,

CONFLICT WITH EDUCATION DEPARTMENT As the education department became more centralised, 
however, it did not welcome Hume's educational initiatives. The role of the district officer too changed - the officer was a 
vital adjunct of the colonial administration, and education was 
left to the purview of the education department. Hume also 
admitted the fundamental philosophic differences that 
existed between him and the educational department over the 
appropriate curriculum for the village schools but he argued 
education had to suit the probable career of the student, and 
the overwhelmingly majority in an agricultural district such as 
Etawah did not need to learn ""cube root in decimals"" or 
other more advanced subjects promoted by the education 
department. In 1862, management of the central school that had been 
vested in the local committee was placed under the control of 
the education department; The system of self-government Hume 
had laboured to initiate was abandoned. Post-1862 saw a 
centralised department control over the entire education scheme 
of the district. In an official communication of September 1865, 
Hume insisted that real popular education would not be realised 
until the government gave it a top priority and made its 
propagation a prime responsibility of district officers. Hume had also started a printing press for books for the 
halkabandi schools, which was disrupted on account of the 
revolt of 1857. In 1863, the government's decision to centralise 
all official printing at the government press threatened the 
existence of the Etawah educational press that published the 
occasional journal People's Friend sent to all schools in the 
district and also zamindars and patwaris. It soon became evident that when the elements of local 
involvement and support that had characterised Hume's educa­
tional system were lost, there was a gradual decline both in the 
number of schools and of students being educated in the 
district.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=137

education in Etawah from 1863-64 to 1865-66. In 1863-64, Etawah had 142 halkabandi schools with 3,958 
students and six tahsili schools with an average enrolment of 86 
students for a total of 516. In the next two years, tahsili schools
120 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekf:y 
had ceased to form a separate administrative category, in 
Etawah at least, for data gathering purposes, and statistics were 
available only for halkabandi schools. The halkabandi schools 
in 1864-65 numbered 137 with 3,597 students and in 1865-66, 
there were 133 schools and 3,531 students. A significant decline 
from 1861 when Hume reported that there were 185 schools 
(including seven tahsili) and some 8,700 students. The Etawah 
central school had fared better and grown from 282 students in 
1861 to an average of 377 by early 1867. Hume obviously had 
a sound point when he emphasised the importance of involving 
the people and officials of the district in the overall development 
of modern education. POST-1857 The constraints imposed by centralisation and the ideology 
of empire meant an expansion as well as a changing role for the 
bureaucracy. The district officer's role became largely admini­
strative, and especially involved an oversight of revenue admini­
stration. The education department for every province was in 
turn responsible for educational initiatives. The emphasis on 
recruiting bureaucrats to serve the empire meant the stress on 
university education, and English and law were the most sought 
after subjects in colleges and at the university level. At the ground level, an honoured place in the new educa­
tional curriculum accrued to land measurement and registra­
tion, but the old had now to give place to the new. Revenue 
administration, a critical factor in reasons for the revolt, 
constituted an important aspect of the empire's new focus.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=138

1870, the establishment of revenue, agriculture and commerce 
at regional levels signalled the restructuring of land revenue 
bureaucracies as w^ll as the beginning of a new round of 
rationalisation of systems of revenue settlement [Goswami 2004; 
Barrow 2003]. New techniques for rationalised mapping of 
land and revenue assessments spawned a ""revolution"" in the 
everyday operations of land surveys and settlement. The 
central organising principle of revenue assessment was based 
on a mathematically derived average rental rate determined by 
soil types. It displaced older systems recorded by the patwaris 
and especially the 'nikasi' - the roll of cultivators. The nikasi
New Lamps for Old 121 
embedded within local complex social structures and agrarian 
practices reflected the reciprocal structure of dues and claims 
that defined the locally specific relations between landlords 
and peasants. Maps too came into increased circulation 
[Barrrow ibid]. The education of the ""masses"" secured through vernacular 
education at the primary and secondary school level was 
oriented towards useful, practical knowledge. A crucial element 
in the restructuring of the educational curriculum was the 
centrality accorded to a vocational variant of ""European"" 
sciences. An official directive from the mid-1850s titled ""reports 
on educational books in the vernacular"" laid out the broad 
pattern of the educational curriculum of vernacular medium 
schools especially with regard to the ""communication of Euro­
pean knowledge and science"" [Goswami op cit]. This meant the decline and gradual oblivion of the use of 
Persian and Arabic as a medium of instruction. Already these 
languages had come under sustained criticism, as seen in 
Hume's reactions to the school textbooks used. Even Nazir 
Ahmed at the Delhi College found many of the texts which were 
a part of the traditional curriculum especially of Persian 
objectionable. For instance, Gulistan that constituted one of the 
core texts for Muslim education was removed from the curri­
culum as its contents in no way were related to the context of 
children's lives. A massive programme commenced for the translation of 
English works into vernacular languages.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=139

works. From now on as it sought to develop the native mind,

THE first step in any contemporary reading of Savarkar's 
account of 1857 ought to be the title of the book itself. It is often 
cited as The First War of Indian Independence - 1857. By all 
accounts, the insertion of the word ""first"" is a later interpolation. The Savarkar Samagra1 mentions it as Atthharahasau Sattavan 
Ka Svatantrata Sangram (The War of Independence of 1857). The 
Marathi title is Atthharahasau Sattavanche Swatantrya Samar. Vasanth Krishna Varad Pande, a Savarkar admirer, calls it The 
Indian War of Independence of 1857.2 Writing about Savarkar's 
years in London, Harindra Srivastava3 gives a detailed account 
of the years leading to the publication of Savarkar's history of 
1857, and clearly mentions the title as The Indian War of

versions of the Savarkar Samagra, it is safe to assume that the 
title is The War of Independence of 1857. Another important next step before considering Savarkar's 
history of 1857 is to read an important essay by Savarkar titled 
'Hindu Sangathankarta Swarashtra Ka ltihaas Kis Tarah Likhein 
Aur Padhein'5 ('How Those Working for Hindu Consolidation 
Ought to Write and Read the History of Their Own Nation'). Savarkar begins by arguing that for the existence of the Hindu 
Rashtra, the present ought to be made formidable and powerful. 124 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week07 In doing so, the knowledge of the past was extremely crucial. The history of the Hindus, however, was one of the emergence 
of 'Bharatiya sanskriti' through the process of weaving together 
all diversities, differences and pluralities into the sense of 
national unity. But reading Hindu history for Savarkar was also the history of 
foreign aggression and influences and the way in which these 
were fought and absorbed into the Hindu cultural and 
civilisational matrix. The early part of this story was one of the 
triumph of Hindu civilisation to overwhelm these foreign inva­
sions and influences. The case of the subsequent Muslim 
invasions was a different one altogether. It is a narrative, argues 
Savarkar, of struggle against Muslims and the eventual defeat of 
the Muslim rule at the hands of Chhtrapati Shivaji, who estab­
lished a Hindu-Padpadshahi or Hindu Empire as a result. For Savarkar, history was, then, to be written in two different 
ways. There was to be a history of the Hindu nation and there 
was to be a history of the encounter of the Hindu nation with 
Muslims. While he exhorts history writers of the Hindu nation to 
be objective and truthful, to write honestly about moments in 
history that were flawed, and do so factually, he goes on to set 
a different set of rules for writing the history of the Hindus and 
their nation.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=142

a different set of rules for writing the history of the Hindus and 
their nation. In a national sense, the differences between Aryans 
and non-Aryans, Brahmin or Shudra, Vaidik or avaidik, Kaayasta 
or Dravid, Jain or Bauddha, Shaiva or Vaishnava were to 
Savarkar superfluous. What mattered in the final analysis was 
that ""our collective lives can be described only by one word. That unique word is Hindu"".6 While history for Savarkar was a 
mixture of the glories and of embarrassing and uncomfortable 
moments, it ought not to be divided into Aryan and non-Aryan 
history. Rather, it ought to be written as the history of the 
Hindu Rashtra. Savarkar's methodology for writing Hindu history, therefore, 
consists of the following trajectory. Hindu historians must not 
ignore, for instance, the conflict between Hinduism and Bud­
dhism, the instance ofJains resorting to arms in order to defend 
themselves, the schism between Shaivites and Vaishnavites. Yet, these instances of conflict and differences ought to be read 
as the history of the ""entire Hindu race, united and consolidated 
as one entity"". 7 Instances in the past of differences and conflicts,
History as Revenge and Retaliation 
125 
suggests Savarkar, ought now to be presented as the common 
and shared social history of the Hindus. At the beginning of this essay, Savarkar had argued for a 
proper study of the past in order to strengthen and consolidate 
the present. But in delineating the manner in which the history 
of the unified Hindu nation ought to be written, Savarkar 
introduces a new element. He says: 
Whatever has happened in the past has been written [in Hindu history] 
factually and objectively. The answers to what ought to be today cannot 
be given by the past. These answers have to be searched in the 
present.8 Not only did ""objective"" Hindu history have very little to 
contribute to the present, but the contemporary Hindu historian 
of Savarkar's conception also had to follow certain rules regard­
ing his reading of the Hindu past: The past ought not to be criticised through the bifocals of the present.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=143

result of a different society and a different situation.9 Hindu history, concludes Savarkar, was the story of the 
emergence of a nation called Hindustan, an amalgamation of 
various regions and sub-nationalities. It was the indivisible 
Akhand Bharat. Hindu history, therefore, was the history of all 
nationalities and identities coming together in one single organic 
unity. For Savarkar, there was another ""laughable example of 
history writing that hides the nature of truth"". 1° Congressmen 
who followed the ""crazed world view and orientation of Gandhiji"" 
wrote this history. 11 This history overlooked the cruelties in­
flicted on Hindus by Muslim rulers like Aurangzeb and Allaudin 
Khilji, to mention a few. Savarkar finds no mention in this form 
of history of religious persecution perpetrated by the Muslims; 
on the contrary, he finds this history full of praise for Islam, 
Muslim rule and civilisation. He is irate at the neglect of ""the 
truth that there was a centuries old fight unto death between 
Hindu and Muslim religions, and Hindu and Muslim nations, 
and that finally, Hindus destroyed Muslim rule and broke it into 
pieces.""12 Only the Hindu nation withstood the assault of the 
Muslims, asserts Savarkar, and prevented their ""poisonous 
attack"".13 The only way Hindus and Muslims can co-exist

without the past casting a shadow is by the Muslims acknowl­
edging Hindu strength and supremacy. SWADHARMAANDSWARAJYA When Savarkar's The War of Independence of 1857 was 
published in 1909 (he began writing it in 1907), the ""crazed"" 
world view of Gandhi and his followers, as Savarkar had 
characterised it, had still not been sufficiently formulated. In 
fact, Gandhi's Hind Swaraj was published the same year. The 
two had earlier met in India House in London in 1906. Pandit 
Parmanand, 14 who knew both Savarkar and Gandhi narrates a 
story about Gandhi's meeting with Savarkar at the India House 
in London. Gandhi had dropped in while Savarkar was frying 
prawns. Gandhi raised a political issue. Savarkar cut him short 
and instead invited him to have dinner. Gandhi said he was a 
vegetarian. To which Savarkar retorted that if Gandhi was 
unable to eat with him, how was he going to work alongside 
him.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=144
145,"Gandhi raised a political issue. Savarkar cut him short 
and instead invited him to have dinner. Gandhi said he was a 
vegetarian. To which Savarkar retorted that if Gandhi was 
unable to eat with him, how was he going to work alongside 
him. Savarkar, then, went on to say he was looking for people 
who were ready to eat the Britishers alive, and not baulk at 
eating fish. Savarkar's account of 1857 is replete with instances of ""white 
flesh"" being slaughtered. It is a theme that is a constant refrain 
throughout the text. It is important to note that Savarkar's 
politics was one that divided the world between ""friend"" and 
""foe"". It was not material who the ""foe"" was as long as an enemy 
could be found at all times. In the essay on the way Hindus 
ought to write the history of their nation, the enemy clearly are 
the Muslims. But in his narrative on 1857, the enemy were the 
British. In other words, Savarkar formulated his entire world 
view in terms of well-entrenched, non-negotiable, binary oppo­
sitions. In a rare advaitic vein 
for Savarkar had little time for 
philosophic schools of Hinduism and was suspicious of'advaita' 
- he talks of the nature of the ""Self"" as something that was known 
to itself immutably and without a name or even a form. This 
abstract notion of the ""Selr' gets transformed the moment it 
comes into contact or conflict with a non-self. The ""Self"", then, 
acquires a name and an identity in order to communicate with 
the non-self. In Savarkar's scheme of things, the more he 
engaged in formulating the contours of his ideal ofHindutva and
History as Revenge and Retaliation 
127 
giving it a political colour, the greater was the proliferation of the 
non-selves. Islam and the Muslims constituted the primary 
definition of the non-self, but the British and Christianity, 
Buddha and Buddhism, Gandhi and Ahimsa were at some point 
or the other added to his rogue's gallery of non-selves. Often the 
non-self led to a redefinition of the ""Self'. For instance, while 
Savarkar's understanding of Muslims and Islam was based on a 
caricature, he found several elements from within this under­
standing ""irresistible"", and speaks of having ""absorbed"" a great 
deal of the non-self in order to recast the ""Self'. 15 
In a world divided between ""friend"" and ""foe"", between ""us"" 
and ""them"", there were no rules of morality, no ethical codes, 
when it came to dealing with the ""enemy"". The epigraph of 
Savarkar's The War of Independence of 1857 is instructive.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=145

In a world divided between ""friend"" and ""foe"", between ""us"" 
and ""them"", there were no rules of morality, no ethical codes, 
when it came to dealing with the ""enemy"". The epigraph of 
Savarkar's The War of Independence of 1857 is instructive. It is 
a quote from Swami Ramdas, Chhatrapati Shivaji's guru, which 
reads: ""Die for the sake of Dharma, and while dieing kill all; In 
killing is your victory, your own rule"". 16 While killing was the 
chosen instrumentality, the essence that circumscribed Savarkar' s 
account of 1857 was the establishment of 'swadharma' or one's 
own religion and 'swarajya' or self-rule. Further, Mazzini's 
writings and his role in the unification ofltaly was the inspiration 
behind Savarkar's belief that every revolution ought to have an 
essence. It has to be pointed out that ""dharma"" in this instance 
means religion and does not have the other philosophical 
connotations that are also associated with the term. There is a 
tendency among commentators on Savarkar to misread his 
distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, leading often to 
the conclusion that Savarkar had little to do with religion. 17 
Savarkar argued that there was an inextricable link between 
swadharma and swarajya. The sages of antiquity believed in this 
link, and Mazzini too saw an inseparable link between heaven 
and earth. He further refines the link to argue that ""swarajya is 
worthless without swadharma, and swadharma is powerless 
without swarajya"" . 18 Once the relation between religion and self­
rule had been established, the only thing that mattered was 
killing the British in order to approximate to the essence. The 
British were the ""foe"" in this instance. Here too, Savarkar makes 
no distinction between the British and Christianity. For him, 
India's capitulation to the British rule was an act of genuflecting 
before the kindness of Jesus Christ. Hindus and Muslims were

allies in 1857 against a common enemy, the British, a fact that 
Savarkar constantly emphasises. In the events that led to 1857, 
Savarkar perceives these as an instance of Hindus and Muslims

Savarkar appreciates the way in which maulvis and pandits 
preached jihad against the British/Christians in 1857. There is 
jubilation in Savarkar's account at every instance of a church 
being felled, a cross being smashed and every Christian being 
""sliced"".",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=146

If the imperative was to establish the supremacy of religion 
and attain self-rule, the pursuit of this goal sanctioned killing. Swami Ramdas' exhortation was to kill without entertaining any 
doubts about the question of means and ends. It was war of a 
different kind, bereft of the old codes and rules. In his reading 
of 1857, Savarkar justifies the killing of countless British women 
and children by taking cue from what he calls the ""tactics of 
Maratha warfare"".22 The ideal was that every sacrifice and act of 
valour ought to lead to success. Anything short of achieving the 
desired end was suicide. Therefore, Savarkar writes about the 
increasing rejoicing and enthusiasm of the rebels when they saw 
more and more English blood being spilt. In Meerut, this 
exultation was the result of several women and children being 
burnt alive after their houses were set on fire. 23 In Delhi, the 
rebels went like ""fearsome demons"" to the house of Rev 
Jennings, killed him, but also his young daughter and another 
lady guest of theirs. 24 
On May 16, 1857, several Englishmen were killed. Savarkar 
goes on to describe the fate of the women and children of those 
who were killed: If some woman or child pleaded for mercy, the people shouted: ""Revenge 
for Meerut's chains, revenge for slavery, revenge for the ammunition shed"". This vengeful sword then decapitated pleading head. 25 The rebel soldiers had ""taken the terrible vow of tasting 
English blood, like Bheemsen had done"". 26 No allowance was to 
be given even to those British men and women who had been 
kind-hearted. An old deputy collector was seen running, and 
despite some people inJ aunpur arguing that he was a good man, 
he was killed. Savarkar puts the following dialogue into the 
mouths of the rebel soldiers: ""Nothing of this sort. He is a
History as Revenge and Retaliation 
129 
European and he must die"". 27 Take another instance. In Kanpur, 
colonel Ewart is killed. Here is hew Savarkar describes the fate 
of his wife: That Colonel's wife was standing close by.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=147
148,"27 Take another instance. In Kanpur, 
colonel Ewart is killed. Here is hew Savarkar describes the fate 
of his wife: That Colonel's wife was standing close by. Some people started telling 
her, ""You are a woman and that is why your life has been spared!"" But 
one cruel friend of theirs shouted, ""What woman! Isn't she a white 
woman? If so, cut her into pieces."" Before that sentence finished, its 
terrible import had been made manifest. 28 As an aside Savarkar denies that a single English woman was 
raped despite claims to the contrary. In a sentence that would be 
the delight of any psychologist, Savarkar maintains that 1857 did 
not happen because Indians did not ""get white women"". It 
happened to eliminate the inauspicious white feet from ""our 
home"". 29 
In June, major general Wheeler had entered into an agree­
ment with the leader of the rebels, Nana Saheb, for safe passage 
of men, women and children down the Ganga in Kanpur. This 
is how Savarkar describes the fate they met while their boats 
were moving along the river. He saw this as the celebration of 
the anniversary of Plassey: In the meantime, the boats started burning. English men, women and 
children started leaping in the Ganga. Some started swimming, some 
drowned, some started burning and all of them, sooner or later, were 
killed by bullets. Pieces of flesh, decapitated heads, strands of hair, 
disembodied hands, broken legs, a flood of blood. The Ganga turned 
red ... this is how the anniversary of Plassey was celebrated!3° 
Injhansi, Savarkar describes a more gruesome massacre of7 5 
men, 12 women and 23 children in religious terms by calling it 
'bali' or holy sacrifice: 
Women had little children in their laps and these children were clinging 
on to their mothers. These women, infants and older children clinging 
on to their mothers were guilty of being white and were decapitated 
with a black sword. 31 
With every such massacre of women and children, Savarkar 
notes that the rebels of 1857 spilt British blood with ""great 
relish"". More was to come. Here is Savarkar's unemotional account 
of what happened in Bibigadh, in Kanpur. The scene is one

where the prison guards refuse to massacre the English. Begum 
Saheb, the chief officer of Bibigarh, which is under the rebel

sharp knives in the evening and emerged out of it late in the night. Between their entering and coming out, a sea of white blood spread all 
over. As soon as they entered with their swords and knives, they 
butchered 150 women and children. A pool of blood collected there 
and body parts floated in it. While going in, the butchers walked on the 
ground and while coming out they had to journey through blood. 32 And then, this is what happened next morning: As soon as it was morning, these poor creatures [those who were half­
dead or dying] were dragged out and were pushed into a nearby well. Two children got out from under the weight of bodies and started 
running around the edge of the well. But they were pushed back into 
the well and fell over the dead. 33 
Savarkar comments that the accumulated account between 
the two races had been squared in this manner. Further, at one 
point, when the English caught the rebellious soldiers, and 
before they were hanged, the English asked them why they had 
killed their women and children. The soldiers replied: ""Sir, does 
anyone leave behind the litter of a snake after killing the 
snake?""34 
The story doesn't end here. A justification of revenge, 
retaliation and retribution was carefully built into Savarkar's 
retelling of 1857.35 A massacre, he says, is a terrible thing. It 
happens, however, because humankind has failed to approxi­
mate the lofty ideals of natural justice, peace, parity and 
universal brotherhood. In this day and age, 'asatya', untruth 
rules over satya, truth. We can only wait for an era to dawn when 
truth will rule every heart. If someone in such an era were to spill 
blood or even utter the word 'pratishodh', revenge, he/she 
would automatically be considered vile, wretched and lowly. Acts of revenge in a society where ahimsa, non-violence, and 
justice rule would be considered sinful. Savarkar regretted that such a divine epoch was far from 
being realised. Words like revolt, revolution, rebellion and 
revenge, therefore were legitimate in order to remove injustice 
and bring about parity and justice. Revolt, bloodshed and 
revenge were at once the instruments of injustice and of bringing

that is the reason Brutus' dagger was sacred and that is why the 
bloodshed of Italy's revolution was without blemish. Fear keeps 
a check on injustice. ""For every Hiranyakashyapu"", Savarkar 
quips, ""a Narasimha is essential; every Duhshasana requires 
a Bheema"".36 Revenge, therefore, was the establishment of 
natural law and justice. From this axiom, Savarkar derived a 
principle of nationalism. He claimed that wherever injustice 
increased and nations went up in flames, wherever nationalist 
wars were fought, in such places revenge for injustices that the 
nation suffered were taken by killing the perpetrators of injustice 
of another nation. Any reappraisal of 1857, therefore, is also an opportunity to 
evaluate the terrifying set of propositions introduced by Savarkar 
into the Indian political vocabulary. Even those who differ from 
his conception of Hindutva seem to acknowledge his national­
ism, patriotism and commitment to the cause oflndia's freedom, 
often overlooking the model of retributive violence and its 
philosophical justification that informs much of his conception 
of nationalism and patriotism. Along with a critical view of 
Savarkar, there is also the need, therefore, to examine the 
content of such terms as ""nationalism"" and ""patriotism"", used 
frequently these days to justify inflamed states of emotion and 
violence in the name of abstractions. NOTES AND REFERENCES

The Beginning of 'People's War' in India 
Kaushik Roy 
THE 19th century witnessed the emergence of a new form of 
warfare. The ""limited war"" of the 18th century was replaced by 
the ""people's war"" in the mid-19th century which in turn gave 
rise to ""total war"" during the first half of the 20th century. 1 The 
European 18th century wars were of limited liability fought 
without any moral or ideological issues. Eighteenth century 
European warfare comprised conflicts between the armies 
raised, equipped and fed by bureaucratised monarchies. While 
waging warfare, such armies made clear distinctions between 
the armed forces and the civilians.2 However, all these restric­
tions were wiped away in the era of people's war. According to 
Stig Forster and Jorg Nagler, it was the people's armies that 
conducted the people's war. In such armies, citizens became 
soldiers and the home front was also mobilised to support the 
war effort. As a consequence, the watertight compart­
mentalisation between the home front and the battlefront 
vanished. And public opinion asserted an important role in 
shaping the conduct of such wars.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=152
153,"According to 
Stig Forster and Jorg Nagler, it was the people's armies that 
conducted the people's war. In such armies, citizens became 
soldiers and the home front was also mobilised to support the 
war effort. As a consequence, the watertight compart­
mentalisation between the home front and the battlefront 
vanished. And public opinion asserted an important role in 
shaping the conduct of such wars. 3 John White clay Chambers II 
says that cultural attitudes (mentality which shaped images of 
the enemy) also aided the brutalisation of warfare.4 Soldiers 
were motivated more by ideology rather than cash or monetary 
considerations.5 Long before Forster and Nagler, Eric Robson 
said that unlike the 18th century wars, the revolutionary wars of 
France and the US marked the beginning of the ideological war 
which reached its apogee in the two world wars of the 20th 
century.6 In 1789, the French Revolution, generated the military 
philosophy known as ""the nation in arms"". In accordance with 
this idea, a state with popular sovereignty was stronger than an 
absolutist monarchy because its people willingly contributed 
their blood in defence of the country they considered their
136 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
own.7 And this marked the rise of the people's war. It is to be 
noted that people's war in this context refers to interstate 
warfare and hence is different from the Maoist concept of 
people's war which involves the political mobilisation of certain 
classes by the communist party for conducting guerrilla and 
conventional warfare against the ruling classes. The ""Great Mutiny"" lasted from May 10, 1857 till April 1859.8 In certain aspects, the fighting during this period in south Asia 
approximated the paradigm of a people's war. All the elements 
characterising a people's war were present in varying degrees in 
the conflagration of the mutiny. The East India Company's 
(henceforth EIC) wars with the indigenous powers between 
1770 and 1849 were similar to the European 18th century wars. But, combat during 1857 represented a lethal increase as 
regards scope, intensity and impact on society. Alexander 
Llewellyn asserts that in 1857 both the sides aimed at the 
complete destruction of the enemy. Moreover, the British 
during 1857 fought in India with greater ruthlessness than was 
evident in the Crimean War of the same decade.9 Let us see how 
far the model of the people's war which has been developed 
by the historians in the context of European and American 
warfare is tenable. for India during the Mutiny of 1857. Hence, 
this article compares and contrasts the mid-19th century military 
experience in south Asia with that of North America and 
west Europe. PEOPLE'S WAR DURING 1857-59

Unlike in previous wars, the lives of the prisoners of war were 
not safeguarded either by the ""rebels"" or by the British. In­
stances of prisoners being put to death by the EIC's troops were 
few before 1857. But, execution of prisoners became common 
during the campaigns conducted between 1857 and 1859 in 
India. On May 20, 1857, the 55th Infantry Regiment rebelled at 
some distance from Peshawar, and Colonel John Nicholson 
attacked them. His forces killed 150 of them and captured 
another 100. Of these prisoners, 40 were blown away from the 
mouth of the guns and the rest were hanged. rn Nicholson was no 
exception. As the EIC's troops advanced towards Lucknow in 
November 1857, one British participant wrote: ""During the day
The Beginning of 'People's War' in India 137 
when we were encamped I saw several men hanged, without 
trial, by the soldiers, who had been taken with arms in their 
hands"". 11 On January 29, 1858, when Hugh Rose's troops 
belonging to the Central India Field Force occupied the fort of 
Rahatgarh, about 84 rebels were captured and 24 of them were 
executed. 12 Frequently, the rebels eliminated the prisoners. On 
June 8, 1857, the rebels attacked the fort ofjhansi. Around 5 pm, 
the British surrendered on condition that their lives will be 
spared. As soon as they surrendered, the prisoners were put to 
the sword. 13 
The distinction between combatants and non-combatants 
vanished in the case of people's war. Forster and Nagler claim 
that the Civil War in the US of 1861-65 and the Franco-Prussian 
War of 1871 witnessed the evolution of a strategy directed 
against the civilians. This was because the civilians were neces­
sary to sustain the war effort and the former often also joined the 
people's armies. The people took up arms and were either 
mobilised from above or they mobilised on their own spontane­
ously. 14 Subaltern historiography ascribes autonomy and agency 
to the ordinary people. The practitioners of this approach assert 
that popular initiative shaped the mass violence that unfolded 
against the alien regime in 1857. 15 Rudrangshu Mukherjee goes 
on to say that the rebels indulged in acts of symbolic violence. Instances of popular unrest were symptoms of popular hatred 
and anger. 16 
The Confederate forces during the Civil War in the US 
attacked the towns and seized the cargoes held by Union 
sympathisers.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=154

The Confederate forces during the Civil War in the US

non-combatants and private property in an urge for revenge. For the rebels, the prime targets were the white people, their 
houses and business enterprises. On May 4, 1857, Archdale 
Wilson wrote to his wife from Meerut: ""The 85 men [3rd 
Cavalry] who refused the cartridges are to be tried in lump, they 
have taken now to burning bungalows. Last night they burned 
an empty bungalow and that of the Q M Sergeant and some 
days ago a picket's stable, and one of the men's huts. ""18 Wilson 
on May 11, 1857 wrote from Meerut to his wife: At half past six o'clock just as I had stepped into the carriage for a drive, 
Whish came galloping into my compound to say that both Native 
Regiments and the 3rd Cavalry were in a state of open mutiny and were

an hour's time burnt down nearly every bungalow on the south side of 
the 'nullah', including the General's and Greathed's, and I am very

37th Infantry Regiment attacked the indigo factories of the 
British planters and the houses of the British officers at] aunpur. 24 
All the symbols of state institutions were attacked. It was a 
deliberate and open challenge to the legitimacy of the Company 
Raj. On June 12, 1857 at Lucknow, the 3rd Military Police 
Regiment that was guarding the gaol broke into open mutiny 
and then marched towards Sultanpur. The insurgents burnt the 
cantonments and the houses belonging to the British were 
plundered and then gutted. 25 During August 1857, at Jhansi, the 
rebels made a public bonfire of official records. 26 The rebels attacked everything that stood for the ""west"" not 
only because of their symbolic values but also for the fact that 
they were aware of the military advantages of destroying 
advanced dual use technology products of the Raj. Military 
operations during both the 1857 Mutiny and the Civil War of the 
US were characterised by the use of the field telegraph. 27 Before 
the invention of the electrical telegraph, messengers on horses 
carried orders and instructions to their destinations. 28 During 
the second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-180.5), letters written by

goes on with us this afternoon, and will be set up at our new 
halting place, Garunda, so that when we arrive at our ground we 
shall know at once what is going on at Ambala.""30 The rebels attacked the telegraph lines not only to harm the 
British but to use that technology to the best of their advantages. One British officer who fought the rebels has written: 
On our entering the 'thananh' inclosure, we found evidence of the 
preserving ingenuity of the rebels in their having adopted a large 
quantity of the material of our electric telegraph lines to the present 
exigencies of their position. They had dug up a number of cast iron 
screws, in which the telegraph posts are placed, struck off the phlanges 
of the screws, bored touch holes in them, and were mounting them as 
guns on carriages. They employed the thick telegraph wire for fixing 
and strengthening them, besides cutting up a large portion of it into 
small lengths for grape.31 Both the rebels and the British inflicted violence on the 
civilians. Rose's troops attacked unarmed Indian civilians. J H Sylvester, a medical officer with the army made the follow­
ing entry on October 25, 1857 in his diary: The consequence was the men off duty and even some native soldiers 
but chiefly the 86th and Artillery were frightfully drunk having seized 
the native liquor shops. They then commenced looting and killing 
everything black, old men, young women and children! This of course 
was to be deplored but I had anticipated this. They shouted Kanpur, 
Delhi and down they went. [Indecipherable] says he saw a room full 
of dead women with children sucking at their breasts. Other women 
brought out dead, children supplicating for mercy. 32

Benaras to Allahabad, he systematically executed 6,000

docility. The dead bodies hanging at the market places and 
roads were visible symbols of British authority. When the stench 
became too much, the dead bodies were dumped on the carts 
and disposed off.33 Neill was somewhat similar to the Union 
commander during the American Civil War William T Sherman 
whose objective was to make Georgia ""howl"". In 1864, when 
Sherman marched into the Confederacy, the civilians were 
forced out of their home and the cities were torched. In the 
American Civil War scenario, Sherman was no exception. Philip H Sheridan systematically burned the farms of 
Shenandonah Valley.34 Back in British India, there were many 
figures similar to Neill. Several gibbets were constructed at 
Benaras where the commissioner, M R Gubbins, provided 
""justice"" by hanging men of high castes.35 The fence sitters as well as the Indian collaborators of the Raj 
were targets of rebel attack. Resaldar Mowla Baksh was in the 
Ramgar Irregular Cavalry when the rebellion broke out. He had 
35 years of service behind him. During the Mutiny, he refused 
to join the mutineers despite threats as well as inducements from 
the rebels. Due to Mowla Baksh's tact and leadership, the 
Ramgar Irregular Cavalry stationed at Chhotanagpur remained 
loyal. In retaliation, the rebels burnt his house and looted his 
property. 36 Those Indians manning the non-military branches of 
the Company state were also attacked. When the rebels entered 
Delhi through the bridge of boats, they cut down the toll 
keepers. 37 In Jhansi, the Bengalis became the special target of 
the rebels as they were manning the clerical establishment of the 
Company state. 38 
Before 1857, the EI C rarely executed civilian officials of the 
princely governments whom they fought. An exception oc­
curred in 1781 during the First Anglo-Maratha War, when the 
EIC's detachment under General Goddard marching from 
Kalyan to the Konkan put to death a few 'chowkidars' _(civilian 
officials) of the Peshwa.39 But, during the Mutiny, those Indian 
civilians and government officials suspected of being in league

with the mutineers received short shrift at the hands of the EIC's 
soldiers. James Graham who fought against the rebels had 
written about November 1857: ""From Fatehgar we went off to 
[Grand] Trunk Road and I think as far as Kanpur, and halfway 
back again, to protect a convoy of ladies and children coming

down from Agra, and to prevent the Nana's brethren and party 
crossing from Awadh. However, he did cross, by our police 
guard sending our boats for them, and I saw seventeen of the 
said police guard hanging in one tree, if I remember rightly, in 
consequence. ""40 
For sMrvival both the EIC's troops as well as the rebels looted 
the civilians, a feature which was absent in the pre-1857 warfare 
in India. Onjune 12, 1857, the situation was desperate for the 
rebels inside Delhi. They were left with only three days provi­
sions. 41 So, the rebel soldiers resorted to looting the merchants 
and traders of Delhi. Onjune 18, 1857, the desperate 'Padshah' 
(Bahadur Shah Zafar) issued an order that looting by the troops 
inside Delhi will not be tolerated. Those soldiers who indulged 
in pillage and plundering were ordered to camp outside the 
city of Delhi. 42 
A 'DIFFERENT' WAR 
During the Anglo-Sikh and Anglo-Maratha Wars, only rarely 
did the EIC's troops resort to pillaging. In September 1781, 
when the First Anglo-Maratha War was going on, Goddard 
fleeced Rs 40 lakh from the merchants of Surat. 43 It was an 
anomaly. Rather, the EIC's military commanders were careful 
enough to pay the villagers whatever the soldiers took from 
them. During the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803-05), Arthur 
Wellesley paid in cash for the rice which he collected for his 
soldiers. 44 But, 1857 was a break in this regard. Raffi Gregorian 
has shown that after recapturing Delhi, the EIC's soldiers 
indulged in looting Delhi with unprecedented ruthlessness 
motivated by a spirit of retribution. 45 One British civilian officer 
turned soldier writes about the EIC's logistical method in the 
following words:",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=159

reinforcements from Meerut, two Horse Artillery guns, and a party of 
Carabineers, who had orders to hold the Ghat for us. They had 
been marching, like ourselves, all night; but not having any of the 
Meerut district officers with them, and the Ranghur village of 
K.iwai, at which they halted, being badly affected, they had nothing to 
eat. When I rode over in the evening, the soldiers had been starving 
for nearly twenty four hours .... I at once entered the village to arrest 
the head men, telling them that they would be paid if they brought
142

food, and their houses fired if they did not. Seeing a couple of calves 
careering about, I seized one, and one of orderlies another: these we 
presented to the carbineers. 46 The village headmen were also taken hostages as security for 
the government revenue. 47 
Unlike previous conflicts in south Asia, women became an 
integral part of warfare. The horror of warfare during the 
Mutiny also touched the white women. One British woman 
jotted down in her journal on June 30, 1857 about the conditions 
in Lucknow Residency in the following words: At nine o'clock we were in a state of siege, completely invested by the 
enemy, and tremendous firing commenced. A very fierce attack was 
made on the Bailee Guard Gate at the back of this house. No sooner 
was the first gun fired than the ladies and children were all hurried 
down stairs into an underground room, called the Tye Khana, damp, 
dark and gloomy as a vault, and excessively dirty. Here we sat all day, 
feeling too miserable, anxious, and terrified to speak, the gentlemen 
occasionally coming down to reassure us and tell us how things were 
going on. James was nearly all the day in the hospital, where the scene 
was terrible: the place so crowded with wounded and dying men that 
they had no room to pass between them, and everything in a state of 
indescribable misery, discomfort, and confusion.48 
Despite the assurance of the ""gentlemen"", the distress of the 
women increased when on the next day they saw terrible face of 
war.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=160

dark and gloomy as a vault, and excessively dirty. Here we sat all day, 
feeling too miserable, anxious, and terrified to speak, the gentlemen 
occasionally coming down to reassure us and tell us how things were 
going on. James was nearly all the day in the hospital, where the scene 
was terrible: the place so crowded with wounded and dying men that 
they had no room to pass between them, and everything in a state of 
indescribable misery, discomfort, and confusion.48 
Despite the assurance of the ""gentlemen"", the distress of the 
women increased when on the next day they saw terrible face of 
war. OnJuly 1, 1857, the above mentioned woman made the 
following entry: ""Poor Miss Palmer's leg was shot off this 
afternoon at the Residency. Sir Henry Lawrence too had a 
narrow escape; a round shot passed just above his head through the 
room in which he was sitting. The firing has been incessant the 
whole day, and we have been close prisoners to the Tye Khana.""49 The emergence of people's war allowed the women in India 
to come out of purdah in order to direct public affairs. The 
participation of women in warfare in India before 1857 was very 
limited. The Nizam of Hyderabad had two battalions of female 
sepoys of 1,000 each. In 1795, they took part in the battle of 
Khardah against the Marathas:50 In 1857, the most famous 
female warlord to emerge on the Indian side was Wajid Ali's 
beautiful Begum Hazrat Mahal. Hazrat Mahal, originally a 
dancing girl named Iftikhar-un-nisa hailed from a poor family. In 1856, when Wajid Ali Shah was deposed by the British and

leftLucknow for Kolkata, she remained in Awadh. The Begum's 
ambition was to make Awadh independent of the British and to 
place her son Bajris Qadr on the throne. In August 1857, 12-year 
old Bajris Qadr was crowned and his mother emerged as the real 
power behind the throne. Hazrat Mahal got her son's enthrone­
ment legitimised by the rebel government in Delhi. She 
symbolised the spirit of resistance in Awadh. In Awadh the chief 
centre of rebellion was Lucknow, where the rebels under the 
leadership of the Begum went on a strategic defensive. Hazrat 
Mahal used to hold durbar where she provoked the chieftains 
and the soldiers to fight the British with vigour. When Raja Man 
Singh went over to the British side, the Begum confiscated his 
estates. Hazrat Mahal, though no battlefield commander was a 
first grade strategist and a good administrator.51",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=161

the Begum left the city with her retainers and moved into 
northern Awadh. Due to concentric pressure exerted by both 
the EIC's forces and the Nepali Army, in March 1859, the 
Begum's forces comprising 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry 
accompanied by 18 guns was compelled to cross river Gandak 
and move into the Terai region of Nepal:52 The rebel force 
continued to be shadowed by the Bengal Yeomanry Cavalry 
and a detachment of the Nepali Army under Colonel Hem Dal 
Thapa.53 The Begum's force suffered horrendously from disease 
and inadequate food. 54 Due to pressure from the British, Maha­
raja Jung Bahadur refused political asylum to the Begum and 
instead gave her an ultimatum to lay down arms. Otherwise, 
warned Jung Bahadur, the British and the Nepali Army would 
jointly attack the Begum's force. 55 She never surrendered and 
ultimately died in Nepal in 1879.56 Another heroine of 1857 was the Rani of Jhansi. By early June 
1857, the mutineers at Jhansi received Rs 35,000 in cash, two 
elephants and five horses from the Rani. The Rani also raised 
14,000 men and two guns which were hitherto buried within the 
fort to escape the scrutiny of the British.57 Like a true warrior, the 
Rani died in the battlefield. Along with elite women there was 
also spontaneous involvement of women at the subaltern level. On April 30, 1858, Hugh Rose wrote as regards the siege of 
Jhansi: ""The women were seen working in the batteries and 
carrying ammunition"". 58

a very important role in strengthening morale, sustaining the home 
front and in vital non-combat jobs associated with armies i e, 
providing food, munitions and other logistical back up.60 In people's war, most of the participants risk their lives not for 
tangible incentives but for ideological reasons. The Confeder­
ate and the Union soldiers were inspired by the ideas of liberty 
and republicanism. Many Confederate soldiers were willing to 
die for the idea of self-government. James M McPherson in his 
study of the combat motivation of the American Civil War 
soldiers asserts that patriotism was the last refuge of genuinely 
committed soldiers especially when the going became tough.61 
Along with the secular ideology of nationalism, religion played 
an important role in egging the participants to participate in the 
""firing line"". In Imperial Germany, Protestantism radicalised 
nationalism especially among the middle class and the intelli­
gentsia. This in turn aided the creation of the spirit of militarism 
which was evident during the First World War. 62 
C A Bayly writes that at least in some portions of India, the 
rebellion assumed the proportions of a patriotic revolt. 63 In 
mid-19th century India, a complex compound between reli­
gion, caste and racial feelings gave rise to anti-'goralog' (white 
men) nationalism among large chunks of Hindus and Muslims 
in north India. The rebels to a great extent relied on mobilising 
the Indians on the issue of religion. The civilian bureaucrat 
George Clerk was quite right in asserting before the Peel 
Commission (which was set up in 1859 to ascertain the causes 
behind the 1857 uprising) that religious fanaticism played an 
important role in the 1857 rebellion. 64 The rebels did not fight 
merely for professional pride or the lure of monetary gains. Those who joined the side of the rebels had an ideology to fight 
and die for. The use of religion as a motivating ideology was 
partly spontaneous. On June 6, 1857, a group of 50 sowars and 
300 sepoys led by Bakshi Ali the jail darogha injhansi raised the 
cry of 'deen ki jai' (victory of religion).65 When the 3rd Cavalry

Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Lowth Harington was near the 
mark when in 1859 he remarked that the rebel soldiers occasionally 
used religion as a medium to legitimise their grievances. 67 The 
rebels used religion to legitimise their action within the wider Indian 
society. And the Indian leaders used this card with ruthlessness. The Rani of Jhansi utilised the issue of religion for gaining recruits 
to her standard. The Rani used religious mendicant'l to fan the 
embers of religious hatred among the people. 68 Nana Sahib also 
played the religious card. On January 2, 1858, Nana's chief 
lieutenant issued the following proclamation from Kalpi: 
My master Sreemunt Maharajah Peshwa Bahadur at the sacrifice of 
every ease and comfort as well as of his wealth, property etc has for the 
purpose of defending the religion both of the Hindus and Muslims 
prepared himself to slaughter the followers of Christ as they are the 
enemies of the faith of the Muslims and Hindus. The said Maharaja 
has, by waging a war with the Christians, put several of them to the 
sword and has resolved not to refrain himself from killing them as long 
as he breathes his living air, and to annihilate at once the people of this 
race now in India.6!1 The rebel leaders painted the conflict as a religious-cum 
racial war to motivate their followers. Besides the strategic objective of using religion to mobilise 
the masses for an all or nothing struggle against the 'feranghis', 
for immediate tactical advantages also religion was used. The 
rebels used religious symbols for ensuring desertion within the 
Indian military contingents loyal to the EIC. On September 19, 
1857, at Thana Bhaon about 10 miles from Sham bee, the rebels 
numbering 3,000 hoisted the traditional green flag of the 
Muslims. The rebels projected the idea that they were fighting 
for Islam against the heretics. As a result, three 'dufadars' and 
13 sowars (who were Muslims from Haryana) of the 1st Punjab 
Cavalry deserted.70

""caste war"". On June 13, 1857, a British civilian wrote from 
Punjab: ""It is lamentable to think that this should all have 
come from a foolish attempt of General Anson to interfere 
with the caste of the men by greasing bullets of their cartridges 
with beef suet and pig's fat mixed, and this (although done 
in ignorance), combined with one or two officers who, with 
more zeal than prudence, preached to their men, led them to 
think the Government intended forcibly to make them Chris­
tians. ""71 The 12th Infantry Regiment stationed atjhansi received 
a letter from the rebel government at Delhi stating that the 
Bengal Army had mutinied. Since this regiment had remained 
faithful to the British, the men had become outcaste and lost 
their faith. Immediately, four sepoys who were ringleaders 
started provoking the regiment to rebel. And finally they 
succeeded.72 
Rumour being the principal subaltern means of communica­
tion played an important role in mobilisation of the insurgents. Rumour evoked comradeship. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak 
writes that the mindset of the illiterate peasants is influenced by 
the phonocentrism of a tradition where 'sruti' - that which is 
heard - has the greatest authority. Her observations are all the 
more applicable to the peasants of mid-19th century India.73 
The Muslim sowars of 1st Punjab Cavalry were also upset due 
to the rumour about the activities of General Cortlandt's force 
operating on behalf of the EIC in Hansi and Rohtak districts, the 
region from which the cavalrymen were recruited. In times of 
trouble, people tend to believe in rumour. The rumour was 
circulating among the men that white troops were killing Indian 
women in an act of vengeance. 74 The Begum of Awadh delib­
erately spread rumours in order to encourage last ditch resis­
tance among the rebels. As the military situation worsened, the 
Begum's followers spread the rumour among the inhabitants of 
Awadh that the British would not only disarm the populace but 
would also deprive them of their caste and religion. 75 
The British were not free from the effects of rumour. The 
terrible anxieties of the British officers and civilians which made 
them susceptible to rumour raised their passion.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=165

The British were not free from the effects of rumour. The 
terrible anxieties of the British officers and civilians which made 
them susceptible to rumour raised their passion. In mid-May 
1857, a rumour circulated among the British inhabitants of 
Lucknow that the rebels were exposing the dead bodies of the 
British soldiers in the streets of Delhi. Instead of giving a
The Beginning of 'People's War' in India 
147 
Christian burial to the dead white soldiers, the British believed 
that the rebels were heaping abuse on their dead bodies.70 
Rumour was also circulating far away from the battlefields. And 
this probably explains the upsurge of raw passion among the 
white civilians far removed from the scene of carnage. John 
Chalmers was a Scottish civilian engineer stationed in Punjab. Onjune 22, 1857, he wrote in a letter from Gujranwala to one 
of his friends: ""I can assure you that my vengeance is so excited 
against the wretches, that I would gladly join in the compact said 
to be entered into, to give no quarter"" .77 On the same date 
Chalmers penned to his friend: ""Hundreds of Europeans have 
been murdered in cold blood; European ladies violated, pub­
licly exposed, and then tortured to death. Soldiers have amused 
themselves by pitching European children about from bayonet 
to bayonet: in fact, they have tortured and murdered every one 
they could overpower with a white face, or who, however black, 
professed Christianity, and this without respect to age or sex.""78 
Even among the white women, there was an upsurge of raw 
emotion. On May 16, 1857, a British woman residing in Lucknow 
noted in her journal: ""You can only rule these Asiatics by fear: 
if they are not afraid, they snap their fingers at you"".79 One of the sources of rumour among the inhabitants of India was 
the free press. In 1857, the press, by modem day standards, showed 
some signs of behaving ""irresponsibly"". In May 1857, the papers 
published in Persian language encouraged the Muslim inhabitants 
of the city to fight the 'feranghis'. 80 One gets a glimpse offunctioning 
of the English newspapers from a letter written by a Scot from 
Punjab. In a letter dated May 30, 1857, he writes:

throne by us, and has received 12,000 sterling pounds a month of 
pension for years, were, after remaining there five days, stripped 
naked, paraded through the crowded streets of the largest city in India 
in that state, under a burning sun, and then killed with spears slowly 
and in cold blood ladies and children who never knew what it was 
before to walk a mile. 81 
Interestingly, even in the US, newspapers of the period, 
which especially enjoyed a wide circulation among the military
148

camps fanned emotions of the citizens of both the Confederacy 
and the Union.82 
The rumour regarding greased cartridges proved to be most 
dangerous for the EIC. Bahadur Shah asserted: 'Kuchch Chil­
i-Rum nahin kya, ya Shah+ Rus nahin,J o kuchuh kya na sare se, 
so cartouche ne' (Not the Sultanate of Rum [Ottoman] not the 
Tsar of Russia made the conquest easy, The only weapon was 
a cartridge). 83 On May 19, 1857, Captain Reynell Taylor, deputy 
commissioner 2nd class in Punjab, at Kangra, wrote to Major 
David Wilkie commanding the 4th Infantry Regiment atN urpur: Yes I believe it is all the cartridge. We had a talk with your native 
officers .. .last night. Their tone was natural enough. They said that of 
course the government was quite right to make its own arrangements 
for the protection of its forts ... They had long eaten the government salt

to the cartridges it was a boon the government withdrawing them. And

LIMITATIONS OF PEOPLE'S WAR The whole Native Regular Army are ready to break out, and unless a 
blow be soon struck the Irregulars as a body will follow their example. Send for our troops from Persia. Intercept the force now on its way to 
China and bring it to Calcutta. Telegram from John Lawrence, chief commissioner, Punjab, to 
G F Edmonstone, secretary to the government of India, May 18, 1857. 81 
Despite highly intense warfare during 1857-59 in India, the 
level of popular participation in the subcontinent was much less 
than the American Civil War. Just before the mutiny, there were 
3,11,000 sepoys, sowars and gunners commanded by 5,362 
British officers and only 40,000 European soldiers (both EIC 
and the Queen's royal forces combined). 86 First, we will con­
sider the military manpower mobilised by the British and then 
by the rebel regime. The Beginning of 'People's War' in India 149 As regards the East India Company's military manpower 
mobilisation, the estimate also includes the mounted police 
raised by the government as they also participated actively in 
fighting the insurgents. In May 1857, the most exclusive Bengal 
Army units were deployed west of river Sutlej, in Punjab the 
British had 38,500 soldiers (12,000 European troops, 16,000 
Punjabi infantry, 9,000 Punjabi cavalry and 1,500 Gurkhas).87 
The Bengal Army units in Punjab either mutinied or were 
disarmed. And the British raised troops from Multan, Ferozepur, 
etc. 88 In 1857, the 1st and 2nd Irregular Sikh Cavalry regiments 
were raised from the ex-Khalsa soldiers who were disbanded 
after the second Anglo-Sikh War. 89 Between 1857 and 1859, the 
number of Indian soldiers in the Punjab Frontier Force (hence­
forth PFF) rose from 25,000 to 43,736 and then to 52,446. The 
PFF recruited Punjabi Muslims from west Punjab (present-day 
Punjab in Pakistan, i e, the area around the Salt Range, etc), 
Trans-Indus Muslims (Peshawar, Kohat) and Sikhs from central 
Punjab (Manjha and Malwa) plus the jats from Haryana.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=168

On April 1, 1858, the loyal elements of the Bengal Army and 
the PFF comprised 80,053 Indians (1,715 in the artillery, 209 
sappers and miners, 11,453 cavalry and the rest infantry). Of 
them, there were only 8,818 low caste Hindus and 572 Chris­
tians. The rajput and the brahmin personnel were drastically 
reduced to 8,526 and 10,363 respectively. The biggest chunk of 
manpower came from Punjab.91 The Bombay Army was com­
posed of Hindustanis (men from north India, i e, brahmins and 
rajputs from Awadh especially), Konkanis and Deccanis 
(Muslims from Deccan).92 The two tables show that in midst of the mutiny, the size of the 
Madras and the Bombay armies did not register any 
quantum leap. The increase in the number of European soldiers 
of the Bombay Army between 1857 and 1859 was significant but 
not massive. By April 1858, there were 96,000 British soldiers 
in the subcontinent backed up by large number of loyal 
Indian troops. 93 
After the recapture of Lucknow in March 1858, the rebels 
spread all over north India and conducted sporadic low level 
warfare against the British. The guerrilla war continued till 
April 8, 1860, when Raja Man Singh betrayed Tantia Tope to 
the British. 94 This prolonged attritional struggle forced the
150

turned against the EIC, the British mobilised the low castes. In 
Awadh, where the anti-British bias among the high caste was 
most intense, the British raised several levies mainly composed 
of low and middle castes. One such levy was the Aligarh Levy 
which was composed of Anglo-Indians, and low castes.96 
Another low caste force was the Fatehgarh Levy.97 The Awadh 
Police Force was composed of ahirs, passis, kurmis, bhungies, 
chamars, lodh, koree, dhannock and bhauts. 98 The British also 
mobilised ""wild tribes"" during the emergency. As early as 1825, 
the British had raised a bheel corps for policing the hilly tracts 
of central India. In 1857, the British raised the 2nd Bheel Corps 
composed of 1,000 bheels. It was used against the mutinous 
troops of Sindia. 99 However, the total number of low castes and 
tribes inducted in the irregular units of the British-Indian Army 
was much lower than the number of regular soldiers. The British also depended on the armies of the Indian princes 
who remained loyal to the Company. The princes ruled over a 
large chunk of territory and the total number of inhabitants 
under their rule numbered 4,00,00,000. 100 Thejammu Contin­
gent of Maharaja Gulab Singh of Kashmir and the Subsidiary 
Force of Hyderabad (10,698 men) did good service for the 
British during the Mutiny. 101 The army of the neighbouring 
friendly princely state of Nepal was also put in the field against 
the rebels. In 1858, during the Lucknow campaign,.Jung Bahadur 
bought 16,000 Gurkhas. 102 
The British also ordered several Indian chieftains and landed 
magnates to raise armed men for maintaining law and order on 
behalf of the EIC. For instance Saifullah Khan, a Muslim 
gentleman in the rajput state of Karauli in central India raised 
600 matchlock men for aiding the British. 103 Numerous such 
examples could be given. However, the number of such infor­
mal forces raised by the British was much less than the size of 
the regular units at the disposal of the EIC. The Beginning of 'People's War' in India 151 The rebels depended on those sepoys and sowars who had

171,"However, the number of such infor­
mal forces raised by the British was much less than the size of 
the regular units at the disposal of the EIC. The Beginning of 'People's War' in India 151 The rebels depended on those sepoys and sowars who had 
mutinied and also raised men from the territory which they 
briefly controlled. A rough estimate of the sepoys and sowars in 
the rebel camp could be made. The Bengal Army's cavalry 
regiments recruited Muslims from Awadh and Rohilkhand and 
the infantry regiments were composed of high caste Hindus 
from Bihar and Awadh. Very few middle castes like ahirs were 
in the Bengal Army. Low castes and Eurasians were not allowed 
entry. 104 The bhumihars from Bihar started joining the Bengal 
Army infantry from the late 18th century. ws Most of the brahmins 
of the Bengal Army infantry came from Baiswara and Banoda 
districts of Awadh. 106 In P JO Taylor's estimate, about 1,00,000 
Indian soldiers rebelled. By July 1858, due to death and 
desertion, only 15,000 of them remained. 107 Stephen P Cohen 
says that out of 1,30,000 Indian soldiers of the Bengal Army, 
70,000 joined the revolt, 30,000 deserted or were disarmed and 
30,000 remained loyal to the EIC. 108 
Several princely armies also joined the rebels. For example 
the Gwalior Contingent which comprised seven infantry regi­
ments, two cavalry regiments and five artillery battalions en masse 
joined the rebels. The Mehidpur, Malwa, Bhopal and Kotah 
Contingents along with Bharatpur Cavalry revolted during 
1857. t()(J The rebel leaders also raised several levies of armed 
men. The Begum of Awadh's force ( comprised of the mutinied 
regiments plus levies raised by her) which crossed river Gandak 
was estimated as numbering 40,000 men. no By February 1859, 
the Awadh Begum's force moving along the Awadh-Nepal 
border numbered between 5,000 to 10,000 cavalry and 10,000 
infantry. 111 However, no accurate estimate of the princely 
units and levies in the service of the rebels could be made due 
to lack of data. Before the beginning of the Civil War, the American Army 
was in a much more pitiable state when compared to the Sepoy 
Army. The United States' regular army numbered only 16,000 
men and had no officers who had commanded any formation 
bigger than a brigade in battle. 112 However, in the course of war, 
mass mobilisation became the order of the day. In total, some 
three million men saw action on both sides in course of the 
Civil War.113 The population of North America in 1860 was 
31 million. The Confederacy and the· Union resorted to

conscription during April 1862 and March 1863 respectively.114 The total enlistment in the Union Army numbered 2,898,304 
and in the Confederate Army about 1,406,180 men.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=171

tion was absent in India because of India's huge demographic 
resources and low manpower demands during the mutiny 
compared to the American Civil War. The population of India 
exceeded 200 million. 116 Even the Crimean War witnessed 
mobilisation of larger number of military manpower. Against a 
force of 3,00,000 French, English, Sardinian and Turkish 
soldiers, Russia in 1856 mobilised 31,954 officers, 17,42,343 
men and another 25,00,000 militia and irregulars. 117 
Excluding civilian casualties, the American Civil War cost 
the lives of 3,60,000 Union and 2,60,000 Confederate soldiers. 118

173,"The mutiny of 1857 witnessed much less casualties. During the 
mutiny, about 2,034 British soldiers died in action and another 
8,978 died from disease. The number of civilians and Indian 
soldiers killed exceeded l,OO,OOO.ll9 The rebels mobilised a 
larger number of men compared to the EiC but suffered greater 
casualties. Besides inferior hardware, command was a serious 
problem with the rebels. Most of the Indian officers of the Bengal Army units which 
mutinied provided leadership to the rebels. In the Bengal Army 
the sepoys were promoted to officer ranks on the basis of 
seniority. On an average, the recruits joined the army when they 
were about 17 years old. A minimum of 35 years of service were 
required for getting promotion to the rank of 'jemadar'. How­
ever, all the sepoys were not that lucky. And about 13 years 
service as a jemadar was required before securing a promotion 
to the rank of 'subadar'. So, the average age of the subadars and 
jemadars were about 70 and 65. Most of the Indian officers due 
to their age were infirm and ready for transfer to the Invalid 
Corps. 120 A huge percentage of the Indian officers were indeed 
illiterate. The Indian officers did not have to pass any test or 
examination for a promotion from a lower grade to a higher 
one. 121 Hence, they were not that combat effective either 
mentally or physically. In addition, the emergence of the people's war also witnessed the 
rise of several civilian leaders among the Indians. The best 
commander on the rebel side was Tantia Tope (real name 
Ramchandra Pandurang) a brahmin aged 41 with a pock­
marked face. 122 He was no match for the professionals of the 
EiC. He was a 'musahib' (companion) of Nana Saheb before the 
outbreak of the mutiny. He had no military experience or 
training. At his young age he was trained only in fencing and 
shooting. 123 The inability of the rebel leaders to command and 
coordinate large formations and their inadequacies in grasping 
tactical complexities resulted in the military defeat of the rebels 
in most of the battles. In contrast, the British officers were professionals. Profession­
alism consisted of expertise in the application of organised 
violence. Those who entered commissioned ranks had educa­
tion in the military academies and their career advancement 
depended on acquiring further knowledge in their profession. 154

technical education to those officers who joined the engineering 
branch and the artillery units. The officers of the infantry units 
were educated at Sandhurst and the EIC's military seminary at 
Addiscombe. It is true that due to the prevalence of the 
purchase system, professionalism among the British officer 
corps was much lower compared to the German officer corps. 124 
Nevertheless, the British officers in terms of technical expertise 
and education in the theories of warfare were head and shoul­
ders above the Indian rebel leaders. And in case of the 
American Civil War armies, West Point graduates provided the 
leadership. Modelled on the Ecole Polytechnique in France, the 
West Point curriculum emphasised engineering, drill and small 
unit tactics. 125 
CONCLUSION Violence inflicted by both the rebels and the British against 
each other and frequently on the non-combatants and civil 
society had an instrumental function. By inflicting violence, 
both the colonial state and the rebel regime tried to shore up 
their own war effort and weaken that of their enemy. Infliction 
of large-scale violence was necessary to destroy the financial 
and demographic potential of the enemy and also affect their 
morale. So, there was nothing uniquely colonial about the 
savagery against non-combatants displayed by both the British 
and the rebels during 1857-59. The brutalisation of combat was 
due to ideological commitments on both sides. Patriotism and 
a sense of revenge drove the Union and Confederate troops as 
well. Similarly, muscular Christianity and revenge provided fire 
to the British in India. The rebels were motivated by a ""mix"" of 
religion and caste pride that constituted a sort of pre-modern 
nationalism. Again women both in the American Civil War and 
in the mutiny played an important role but their participation in 
actual combat remained marginal. Comparative history is also 
a sort of parallel history. And parallel history like parallel lines 
never meet. So a lot of dissimilarities do exist and can be 
observed between the people's war in the mid-19th century 
North America and in 1857-59 India. The military manpower 
mobilisation in India by both the rebels and the Company 
during 1857 was minuscule (both in absolute numbers as well as

in percentage terms vis-a-vis the population base) compared 
with the mass armies mobilised during the American Civil War.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=174

more intense in North America during the Civil War compared 
to the role played by the tribes and low castes in India during 
the 1857 uprising. Nevertheless, both the American Civil War 
as well as the 1857 Mutiny irrevocably changed the face of war. NOTES The story of linear evolution of total war is teleological and has been 
challenged by several historians. Still, I think such a developmental 
model is helpful in understanding the gradual unfolding of warfare in 
Eurasia and North America between late 18th century and the fourth 
decade of the 20th century. 2 Eric Robson, 'The Armed Forces and the Art of War' inJ O Lindsay (ed),

The Rebel Army in 1857 At the Vanguard of the War of Independence 
or a Tyranny of Arms? Sabyasachi Dasgupta 
THIS paper argues that the ""mutiny"" by the sepoys was an act 
of repudiation not only against the East India Company or 
Company but also the traditional ruling class of Indian society. It was an assertion of autonomous power, a force that threatened 
to sweep away symbols of colonial power in northern India. It 
also threatened to alter traditional power equations in indig­
enous society. The nature of the outbreak and the rapidly 
evolving political dynamics during the course of the mutiny 
represented a severe threat to established hierarchies in indi­
genous society. The sepoys sought to rapidly carve out an 
autonomous space for themselves within the power hierarchy. There has been the argument that the sepoy assertion was not 
synonymous with people's power. That the autonomy of the 
sepoys did not represent the autonomy of the people. This paper 
seeks to differ with these representations and places the sepoys 
at the vanguard of the people's rebellion. Historians have 
argued that the grievances of the sepoys merged with those of 
the people or the peasantry. Some have gone so far as to say that 
the sepoys were peasants in uniform. I argue that the sepoys despite their strong links with their 
parent society possessed a distinct identity and considered 
themselves apart from indigenous society. Company service, 
which they were to so violently repudiate in 1857, conversely 
gave them a sense of empowerment. The sepoys aspired to be 
the new elite and were ready to take on the old elite and the 
common peasantry in this endeavour.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=188

middle farmer background and hardly belonged to the elite of 
indigenous society. A perusal of the class and caste base of the 
Bengal Army would help elucidate this point better. CASTE AND CLASS COMPOSITION OF THE BENGAL ARMY The Bengal Army or more specifically its infantry units 
consisted mainly of high caste men from Awadh and Bihar. 1 The 
Company's main catchment area corresponded to modern day 
eastern Uttar Pradesh and the Bhojpur region of present day 
Bihar. The Bengal Army's recruiting policy was motivated by 
strong and enduring beliefs which held that the high caste sepoy 
hailing from a yeoman farmer background was naturally obedi­
ent, faithful, brave and constituted in general excellent soldier 
material. 2Though the 1830s and 1840s would see the increasing 
representation of Gorkhas and Sikhs in the Bengal Army, high 
caste domination would be intact in the years leading up to 
1857. If the caste composition of the 34th Regiment infantry 
stationed at Meerut prior to 1857 is taken as representative of 
general recruitment patterns in the Bengal Army, high castes 
still comprised over 50 per cent of the Bengal Army. 3 The general mode of recruitment was to ask serving sepoys 
and officers leaving for their native village on furlough, to bring 
back high caste recruits from among their relatives and 
neighbours. The induction of Sitaram into the Bengal Army is 
an apt example. Sitaram was born in the village of Tilowee in 
erstwhile Oudh and modern UP in 1797. His father was a 
yeoman farmer who owned about 150 acres of land. Sitaram 
joined the army in 1812 at the behest of his uncle who was a 
jemedar in the Bengal Army. 1 The uncle had been granted six 
months of furlough and on his way home stayed with Sitaram's 
family for some days. He soon settled into a routine of every 
evening narrating wondrous tales about the lands Company 
service had taken him to and of the immense prosperity of the 
Company to a crowd of awestruck listeners including his 
nephew. Sitaram was filled with wonderment at these stories 
and longed for the time when he might be a soldier in the 
Company Army.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=189

and longed for the time when he might be a soldier in the 
Company Army. As Sitaram says: 
The rank ofjemedar, I looked on as quite equal to that ofGhazi-ud-din 
Hyder the king of Oudh himself, in fact of even more importance. He

had such a splendid necklace of gold beads and above all he appeared 
to have an unlimited supply of gold mohurs. I longed for the time when 
I would possess the same which I then thought would be directly mine 
if I became the company bahadur's servant:1 His uncle observing the rapt attention with which Sitaram 
heard his tales, laid before him the possibility of joining the 
army. Sitaram jumped at the prospect of enlisting in the army 
despite knowing that his mother who wished him to become a 
priest would object strenuously. The uncle left for his native 
village 50 miles away saying that he would enquire on Sitaram 
on his way to rejoining his regiment on the expiration of his 
furlough. If Sitaram was still steadfast in his resolve then he 
would take the boy along with him with the intention of enlisting 
him in his own regiment.6 Sitaram's narrative makes it amply clear that the Bengal 
Army was in some measure a closed institution where ties of 
caste, clan and residence predominated. Village life and ties 
were to an extent replicated in the army as the native recruits 
made their own living arrangements by constructing huts in a 
manner not very different from their native villages. All this 
ensured that the sepoys retained strong links with their parent 
society. Regular visits home on furlough to visit their families, 
which they had left behind, also ensured a periodic regenera­
tion of their contact and affinity with their parent society. THE SEPOY: A PEASANT IN UNIFORM? The strong links of the sepoys with their parent society 
coupled with their middle farmer origins have led historians 
such as Rudrangshu Mukherjee to argue that the sepoys were 
basically peasants in uniform. Mukherjee asserts that the partici­
pation of the peasantry in1857 assumes greater significance as 
the sepoys were after all peasants with close ties with their kin 
in the villages. According to him, this ensured that the peas­
antry often took on autonomous initiatives shedding their 
· subordinate status. He argues that this is why landed magnates 
like Beni Madho for instance were persuaded by the sepoys and 
his clansmen to continue fighting.7",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=190

doubt that the sepoy had significant links with his parent society,
164 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
he does not take into account the fact that army life and training 
must have moulded his mentality to an extent. This is true for 
all professional armies and the Bengal Army was no exception. Huntington for instance argues that the members of the same 
profession exhibit a notion of organic unity and conceive of 
themselves as a group distinct from laymen, in this case the 
civilian. This sense of unity ensures that an index of professional 
competence and responsibility is created. Huntington in short is 
thus attempting to define ""corporateness"", the creation of a 
distinct soldier identity or what is often defined as a corporate 
identity.8 I seek to demonstrate that the recruitment policy of the 
Bengal Army would ensure that the Bengal sepoy would 
develop a hybrid identity. His separation from his parent society 
would be imperfect. He was neither a peasant in uniform nor did 
he perceive himself as totally distinct or cut off from his parent 
society. He had multiple identities and it was the uniqueness of 
the situation, which led him to assert a particular aspect of his 
identity. After all, his conflict was not only with the colonial 
government, he was also jockeying for power within his own 
parent society. When it came to it, he would emphasise the fact 
that he was a Company sepoy, a truism which rendered him 
distinct and possibly antagonistic to his parent society despite 
his strong links with it. This antagonism would be revealed in his active conflicts with 
both the non-privileged peasantry and the native elite. The 
sepoys were a terror to all sections of society. They often 
misused their access to the British resident of Lucknow with the 
intent of establishing fraudulent claims. Sleeman mentions an 
invalid subedar, Sheik Mehboob Ali, who acquired a village 
from a great landlord by influencing the resident, thereby 
establishing his claim on it. Company service was thus giving 
him a leeway, status and influence, which he could not 
otherwise aspire to.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=191

from a great landlord by influencing the resident, thereby

him a leeway, status and influence, which he could not 
otherwise aspire to. The sepoy on his part was determined to 
make the best possible use of the advantages Company service 
offered to him. 9 
Sitaram's autobiography also gives us a vivid picture of the 
leverage Company service offered to the sepoys. Sitaram while 
narrating the circumstances, which led to him joining the Bengal 
Army, says that his father was hardly averse to the idea though
The Rebel Army in 1857 165 
his mother was terribly upset at the prospect of Sitaram being 
drafted into the army. His father was anticipating a prospective 
legal battle over a mango grove the family owned. Evidently 
serving sepoys hailing from Oudh could ensure through the 
good offices of the British resident in Lucknow that cases 
involving them and their families would be promptly heard in 
the courts; a privilege ordinary members of indigenous society 
were denied. w 
THE SEPOYS: THE NEW ELITE? The sepoys therefore sought to be the new elite. Service in the 
Company had emboldened and empowered him. He repre­
sented a dynamic force, which sought to dominate the indig­
enous society from where he originated and to which he 
belonged despite his often acrimonious relations with his parent 
society. The mutiny of the sepoys could thus not be equated or 
treated as synonymous with a people's rebellion as some 
historians have sought to portray it. Rajat Ray, for instance, says 
that the mutiny by the sepoys lay at the very heart of the people's 
rebellion and was the most democratic part of the rebellion. Ray 
argues that the sepoys were not simply peasants in uniform; 
army service gave them a perspective wider than the tiny world 
of the average villager. The average peasant rebellion be­
fore 1857 and till the 1920s, Ray argues, was limited and local 
in nature and sought to base itself on kinship ties. Ray posits 
that the peasantry led by the sepoys would strive towards 
forms of government, which contained a democratic and 
republican spirit within what he terms as its hierarchical, 
princely structure. 11 
Ray posits that these sepoys asserted an autonomous zone of 
power for the people by being a decisive voice in the restoration 
of indigenous authority in areas, which had been liberated from 
British rule. Ray says that though the sepoys entertained no 
thoughts of setting themselves up as the government, they 
insisted on having the final say.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=192

Banda had to appease the mutineers after he had summararily 
assumed power. The nawab placated them by inviting them to 
a feast and acknowledging their right to have the final say in all 
matters. Similarly Ray says that the sepoys played a crucial role
166 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
in the restoration of Lakshmibai in Jhansi. The sepoys were in 
two minds actually after a dispute with Lakshmibai's delegates. Sadashiv Rao, a kinsman of Lakshmibai's late husband had also 
staked his claim to the throne of Jhansi and these sepoys were 
toying with the idea of preferring his claims over the rani. Ray 
demonstrates that the latter ultimately secured her claim by 
paying the sepoys a large sum of money. Ray also argues that the 
sepoys set up councils through which they exercised power in 
their centres of power such as Lucknow, Delhi etc. 12 
I argue that the revolt of the people could not be termed as 
a revolt of the people with the sepoys as flag-bearers. The sepoys 
during 1857 were a force by themselves. They were neither with 
the people nor were they really interested in restoring the old 
symbols of power. Years of Company service had given them 
the confidence to cast aside their traditional servitude to make 
bold and assertive statements. They had not acquired the 
confidence to totally repudiate the old order. They possibly felt 
that they lacked the legitimacy to do so in the eyes of the people. But they were no longer in awe of traditional figures of 
authority. These sepoys for the time being needed the support 
of the people and traditional ruling class. At the same time they 
had a measure of contempt for both sections. This was exemplified by their behaviour towards the general 
populace. The mutineers at Delhi were often at loggerheads 
with the people of Delhi. They were especially hard on mer­
chants, moneylenders and bankers and did not spare the 
common people either. Their exactions reached such unman­
ageable proportions that people pledged to protect themselves 
against the mutineers.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=193

with the people of Delhi. They were especially hard on mer­
chants, moneylenders and bankers and did not spare the 
common people either. Their exactions reached such unman­
ageable proportions that people pledged to protect themselves 
against the mutineers. Shopkeepers disgusted with the exactions 
of the sepoys refused to open their shops and flooded the 
emperor with complaints. The emperor had to implore the 
shopkeepers to open their shops. Yet the shopkeepers 
could hardly gather the courage to do so. The atmosphere was 
one of dread; the people, the great and the common, lived in 
terror of being at the receiving end of the sepoy's frustration 
and caprice. 13 
Jeevan Lal's diary narrates an incident where the sepoys after 
a disastrous defeat against the British vented their frustration at 
Bahadur Shah's physician, Ahsanullah Khan whom they had 
long suspected of being in league with the British. The palace
The Rebel Army in 1857 167 
was surrounded and there were cries for Ahsanullah Khan's 
head. Alarmed at the conduct of the sepoys, the shopkeepers 
closed their shops. Jeevan Lal says that the Muslim section of the 
city feared that the sepoys would murder Bahadur Shah Zafar 
and indulge in a general massacre. 14 
Such fears were by no means unfounded as the sepoys were 
prone to violence at the slightest provocation. May 21, still early 
days as far as the rebel presence in Delhi was concerned, 
witnessed the massacre of innocent citizens. The ostensible 
provocation was the looting of valuables from the sepoys by 
'budmashes' or bad characters of the city who waylaid them in 
a particular mohalla of Delhi. The sepoys peeved at being 
robbed took their anger out on the innocent people of the 
locality and indulged in a large-scale massacre. 15 
Therefore it is time that romantic notions of sepoys being at 
the vanguard of the people's rebellion are shed. The sepoys 
were on their own with their own agenda though for tactical 
reasons they could not do without the support of the people or 
other traditional figureheads. They had to contend with a 
society, which retained a huge respect for traditional symbols of 
authority. But they looked to be the decisive force or the final 
authority as far as decision-making was concerned. As a result 
sepoy councils sprang up in centres of rebel power such as 
Delhi and Lucknow. The sepoys exercised decisive power 
through these councils, though Bahadur Shah Zafar in Delhi or 
Begum Hazrat Mahal in Lucknow were the ultimate authority on 
paper. The court as it was called in Delhi, for instance, was 
formed after the arrival of Bakht Khan in the capital. It was to 
consist of 10 members, six from the army and four from the 
civilian administration.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=194

consist of 10 members, six from the army and four from the 
civilian administration. All three branches of the army would 
have equal representation. Members were to be elected by a 
majority with the criteria supposedly being intelligence, merit 
and experience. One out of these 10 members was to be elected 
president by a majority vote. Individual members of the court 
would be accountable or the respective departments from 
which they were elected. They would in turn be assisted by 
committees. Hi 
The court held regular sessions for five hours each day in the 
Red Fort while, extraordinary sessions could be convened at 
any time of the day or night. All decisions had to be arrived at
168 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
by majority vote. The court's jurisdiction extended to matters of 
finance, judicial and of course military. The court was authorised 
to impose taxes or to establish law courts, appoint judges 
and police officers. All decisions had to be ratified by the 
emperor and had to bear his will. If the emperor disagreed 
with any decision he could send it back to the court for its 
reconsideration. 17 
In reality it was the sepoys who had the final word. The 
emperor was often compelled to sign and ratify the decisions of 
the newly established court. Bahadur Shah in his defence before 
the trial constituted to try him professed his absolute haplessness 
before the will of the sepoys. The sepoys apparently were in the 
habit of affixing his seal on empty envelops, the contents of 
which he was absolutely unaware. While the emperor for tactical 
reasons may have been overstating his impotence before the 
sepoys, the fact remains that the sepoys at the moment felt 
emboldened enough to dictate terms to anybody. Possibly the 
sheer exhilaration of having risen en masse and having actually 
wiped out for a while the feared Company rule over large parts 
of north India gave them a big psychological boost. They had 
crossed an important psychological barrier. This was not the first 
time that the sepoys had rebelled. A culture of quid pro quo had 
long prevailed in the Company armies. The sepoys rendered 
conditional allegiance in return for certain sentiments being 
honoured and certain obligations being fulfilled towards them. Non-compliance of these obligations or the disregarding of their 
sentiments meant that they were rendered free from the need to 
accord deference.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=195
196,"This was not the first

conditional allegiance in return for certain sentiments being 
honoured and certain obligations being fulfilled towards them. Non-compliance of these obligations or the disregarding of their 
sentiments meant that they were rendered free from the need to 
accord deference. Thus, a mutiny under certain circumstances 
was considered legitimate by the sepoys and did not constitute 
indiscipline. 18 
But 1857 was different. Earlier mutinies had been local and 
limited in their scope and vision. They had not looked to 
challenge the legitimacy of British rule with the possible excep­
tion of the Vellore mutiny. But this was different. This was a 
challenge to the basic foundations of British rule in at least the 
northern part of India. Caught in the first flush of success the 
sepoys were in a state of frenzy and brooked no opposition. A 
strong streak of defiance and assertion was evident in the sepoys 
who rebelled. This was revealed at multiple levels. It was, for 
instance, revealed in the manner in which the sepoys asserted
The Rebel Army in 1857 169 
their right to elect their own officers. The sepoys revived old 
practices such as the 'panch' or panchayat. These were demo­
cratic bodies where decisions were arrived at by consensus 
regarding the course each regiment should take. The Gwalior contingent, for instance, which rebelled on 
June 14, elected a subedar major of the First Regiment to be 
their general. These troops without bothering to elicit the 
consent of their native officers marched to Gwalior where they 
demanded of Scindia his plans regarding the future course of 
action. These sepoys evidently spent their time in convening a 
panchayat and courts and organising deputations to Scindia 
which the latter had no choice but to entertain. Finally on July 7, 
a big contingent of sepoys and officers attended on Scindia in 
the palace gardens and demanded an assurance from him. When Scindia asked them what their wishes were, the officers 
professed to reply but the sepoys interrupted and told the 
maharajah that they had decided to capture Agra and that they 
would not further wait for his orders. 19 
The revolt of the sepoys also seemed to envisage in its vision, 
resentment against their native officers who on the face of it were 
at the mercy of the sepoys. Possibly the sepoys had resented the 
fact that the native officers invariably sided with the European 
officers in clamping down on cases of day-to-day dissent. Native 
officers had a curiously dichotomous attitude.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=196

at the mercy of the sepoys. Possibly the sepoys had resented the 
fact that the native officers invariably sided with the European 
officers in clamping down on cases of day-to-day dissent. Native 
officers had a curiously dichotomous attitude. Previous localised 
mutinies had often found the native officers acquiescing in the 
revolt of the sepoys or in certain instances providing the lead to 
the revolt though, as mentioned before, the native officer sided 
with the authorities when it came to stamping out cases of day­
to-day dissent by sepoys. 20 1857 was different in the sense it was 
the average sepoy who held sway. The rebellion was a manifes­
tation of his multifold resentment, which enveloped in its 
anger multiple layers of hierarchy. No figure was hallowed 
for them, the sepoy's anger and arrogance would not spare 
even the emperor. There were reports that the sepoys, clamouring to be paid, 
addressed the Mughal emperor in disrespectful terms 
('Ari Badshah' or even 'Ari Buddha'). Some were bold enough 
to pull him by the hand while one apparently tugged his beard 
asking him to listen. The sepoys even possessed the audacity to 
demand the queen Zeenat Mahal as a hostage since they
170 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekfy 
suspected her along with Bahadur Shah's physician Ahsanullah 
Khan of being in league with the British. As for Ahsanullah 
Khan their anger against him has already been mentioned. The 
sepoys on one occasion burst into his apartments and looted it. Ahsanullah Khan luckily for him was not present at the time.21 
The mutineers as we saw were hardly respectful in their 
attitude towards Scindia. Their tone towards him was peremp­
tory; they were attempting to dictate terms to him. While they 
did not attempt to totally cast aside his authority, they would 
accept his nominal suzerainty on their own terms. Times had 
changed at least temporarily. The traditional elite could no 
lsnger hope to command without their power being questioned 
and challenged. They were up against a force which had 
developed irreverence for them. The mutineer's contempt for 
traditional authority was further revealed by their behaviour 
du)ing the coronation of Birjis Qadr as the consort ofLucknow. The sepoys crowded into the palace and apparently made a 
general nuisance of themselves. They noisily commented on the 
appearance of Birjis Qadr, some drew mocking parallels with 
the god Krishna, others urged him not to succumb to the 
pleasures of wine and women.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=197

contempt on him for his timid and timorous appearance. One 
sepoy overwhelmed with emotion went so far as to embrace him 
and address him as Krishna. 22 
In the tradition-bound society such manifestations of arro­
gance and familiarity would be unthinkable. But this was a 
sepoy army which had been unshackled. Years of Company 
service had already made them a force to be reckoned with in 
indigenous society. The revolt temporarily made them masters 
of the situation. Their ardour was yet undiminished by serious 
reverses; these were the initial moments of heady triumph. The 
sepoys felt that they could dictate terms to anybody. CONCLUSIONS To conclude one might ask as to what was the significance of 
the mutiny? If the sepoy rebellion did not represent the rebellion 
of the people then what did it represent? Why do we celebrate 
the revolt as the first war of independence? Why should not we 
celebrate say the Santhal and the Moplah uprisings or for that
The Rebel Army in 1857 171 
matter countless other uprisings? Why are their 150th anniver­
saries not commemorated? 2006 was for instance the 200th 
anniversary of the Vellore mutiny, a mutiny which sparked off 
disturbances in several places in the Madras Presidency. Unlike 
1857 the British could nip these disturbances easily in the bud. Strangely celebrations of the Vellore mutiny were muted. One 
reason could be that the Vellore mutiny remained local and 
could not spread to other parts of Madras Presidency as the 
British clamped down on the burgeoning disturbances at other 
centres before they could acquire momentum. Therein lies the 
point. 1857 was unchallenged in its scope, vision and magni­
tude. The sheer breadth of the area and the sheer savagery of the 
conflict were unrivalled. The uprising would pose a fundamen­
tal challenge to British rule in northern India and would 
generate a romance and a process of mystification, which 
endures to this day. However, the question that arises is: Are we then to assume 
that the only significance of the mutiny by the sepoys lay in the 
fact that it was unprecedented in its range and conception? One 
would argue to the contrary. The sepoy rebellion had some 
progressive features in spite of its often antagonistic relations 
with the people. The very fact that they represented a challenge 
to the old feudal elite represented a progressive feature in itself.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=198

to the old feudal elite represented a progressive feature in itself. The sepoys in their desire to pose an alternative were also 
proposing an alternative paradigm of government. They 
possibly realised that they could not hope to repJicate old 
forms of government if they wished to mount a credible 
challenge. Temperamentally too years of serving in an army 
where they were implicitly allowed some leverage had made 
them assertive and confident. They were no longer used to 
being dictated to. This was apart from the general confidence 
army service gave them. Therefore the sepoys though hardly conciliatory in their 
attitude towards the people were democratic within their own 
autonomous sphere or zone of operation. In this lies the most 
significant part of the sepoy rebellion. If we are to imagine a 
scenario where the sepoys would have prevailed, one doubts 
whether there would be a reversion to the old native forms of 
government. The very nature of the success and the huge role 
played by the sepoys would have ensured against this. While it
172 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekfy 
is futile to talk in terms of modern notions of parliamentary 
democracy, it is possible that a new order would have emerged. While the new order might have represented a dictatorship of 
the sepoys over the people and to a lesser extent the old elite, 
the egalitarian strands implicit in the internal world of the sepoys 
would have represented a contradiction. It is possible that this 
contradiction would have resulted in the formation of a order 
which was egalitarian and if I may use the word democratic in 
the truest sense of the term. There lay, one feels, the true 
significance of 1857. NOTES

314. Sleeman says that the sepoys were apt to misuse the privilege of 
petitioning to the resident. They used it to establish all manner of 
fraudulent claims on landholdings or to get their own rent reduced. They 
often tried to get back landholdings lost in the past by pressing fraudulent 
charges before the resident. This is not to say that the sepoys were totally 
immune to the outrages committed by big talukdars. Maheput Singh, a 
notorious landlord, attacked and robbed the properties of several serving 
and retired sepoys and native officers of the Company armies. In most of 
these cases Singh looted and derived ransom for captured family mem­
bers. In one instance he dispossessed the family of a subedar from their 
holdings and turned out all the cultivators. While the aggrieved sepoys and 
officers represented to the resident in all instances and managed to get out 
arrest warrants from the court of the king, Singh's influence with the local 
district representatives of the king ensured that he remained unmolested 
for a time. Singh was in some instances circumspect in attacking sepoys in

14 Ibid. Ghalib's diary too gives us an idea of the absolute anarchy the rebels 
heaped upon Delhi. He mentions that the mutineers looted at will. Houses 
were without discrimination stripped of their belongings. Women with the 
exception of the wife and daughter of the police chief were stripped of their 
jewellery. Ghalib seems to imply that women in Delhi were subjects of 
unwelcome attention from the sepoys and what he called the rabble. While 
Ghalib's account has strong class bias and was written in the post-mutiny 
phase with an eye to exonerate him and emphasise his loyalty, its descrip­
tions of the indiscriminate rapine and loot by the sepoys tally with other 
narratives. Therefore while we should approach his narrative with a critical 
perspective, we cannot discount its account of the sepoys avarice alto­
gether. See Dastanbuy: A Diary of the Indian Revolt of 1857, Asadullah

several unflattering references to the sepoys and their supposed depreda­
tions. Banergee's account mainly dwells on Bareilly and its neighbouring 
areas. Banergee, a clerk in the Bengal Army and a loyalist to the core 
describes a devastated village, which he sees while on his way to Nainital, 
which is still in the hands of the British. On enquiring he learns that the
174

rebel troops had created havoc in the village and the people had fled as 
a result. Durgadas also affirms that the people of Bareilly were glad to see 
the English return. However his account has to be taken with a pinch of salt as he was a loyalist 
and would naturally be biased against the rebels. Having said that, we 
cannot totally disregard his account, as there are other comparatively 
neutral accounts that also point towards the fact that the soldiers were often 
harsh on the common people. While we should be circumspect, we cannot 
disregard such reports of sepoy oppression. See Durgadas Banergee, Amar

Reactivating the Past 
Dalits and Memories of 1857 
Badri Narayan 
I 
DEITIES, HISTORIES AND DAILY LIFE 
IN the Azamgarh district ofUttar Pradesh there is a village called 
Majhauwa which is predominantly inhabited by dalit castes like 
chamar, pasi, dhobi, mali and so on. Next to a narrow footpath 
inside a field in this village lie four cemented stones. These are 
called Shahid Baba by the villagers. The dalits of this village 
worship these stones with red powder; they pour water on them 
and offer home-made sweets like 'thekua', etc, as a form of 
worship, regularly. All newly married brides from these castes 
visit these stones to offer prayers for their future happiness. On 
enquiring about the history of these stones, the village school­
master who is a chamar by caste said that four chamars of this 
village laid down their lives during the 1857 rebellion. These 
four men started appearing in the dreams of the villagers, 
conveying messages that if prayers were offered to these four 
martyrs they would all prosper. Since then they have been 
incarnated as gods in the eyes of the villagers, who constructed 
shrines in their memories and began to pray there for happiness 
and prosperity. 1 
Around the village Shahapur in Arrah district of Bihar, a deity 
called Rajit Baba is worshipped by some lower caste communi­
ties of that region. His 'thaans' (memorial stones) are usually 
found under 'peepal' trees which are decorated with red loin 
cloths, red flag, red powder marks, incense sticks, home-made

These are only two examples which show how, in various 
regions of north India, martyrs of the 1857 rebellion belonging 
to lower castes have become integral components of the lives of 
the dalits living there. The question arises why dalits, whose role 
is not even acknowledged in academic history, have given god­
like status to their own heroes of the 1857 rebellion. Does this not 
reveal the wide gap between academic history writing and 
people's history? Or is the reincarnation of their heroes of the 
1857 rebellion as gods an existential need envinced by the lower 
castes for their own survival because of the refusal of the 
so-called Indian mainstream to acknowledge their very exist­
ence? Or is it because the memory of the 1857 rebellion has 
become deeply ingrained in the collective psyche at the grassroots 
level even though it is claimed that the rebellion was confined to 
kings and feudal lords and the only contribution of the lower castes 
in the struggle was as their soldiers, guards and stick wielders? Who was Rajit Baba who is worshipped with so much 
devotion in the Shahabad region, now in Arrah district of Bihar? When this question raised itself in my mind I sought the help of 
historical archives. I found that there is a mention of a certain 
Rajit Ram in the mail of Allen, dated February 7, 1859 [Vidrohi 
1989: 36]. The narrative of Rajit Ram is as follows: My name is Rajit Ram. By caste I am a 'gwala' (milkman). I was a 
hawildar in the first company of the 40th Platoon whose job was to 
distribute salaries to the soldiers. My father's name is r'arasanram. I am 
a resident of village Shahpur, paragana Shahpur, district Shahabad. At 
this moment my age is 56 years. Since an early age I have been working 
with the East India Company. On July 25, 1857 I participated in the 
revolt in Danapur. Our first attempt was to capture Coilver Ghat and 
then move towards Arrah. I stayed in Arrah for two hours. After that 
I told Sitaram Subedar that I wanted to go home and that I should be 
granted leave. I was granted leave for six days which I spent in 
Shahpur. I then went to the jungles ofjagdishpur.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=204

I told Sitaram Subedar that I wanted to go home and that I should be 
granted leave. I was granted leave for six days which I spent in 
Shahpur. I then went to the jungles ofjagdishpur. The very day that I 
reached we had to leave for Dullepur to combat the British army. Unfortunately we lost, because of which a few of us stayed on in the 
jungles, a few went to Baraun and the rest went to Piro. The next 
morning we all gathered together. At that time Babu Kuber Singh and 
Babu Amar Singh were our leaders. Under their leadership we all went 
to Nokha. From there we went to Sasaram, then on to Tilaubhu in
Reactivating the Past: Dalits and Memories of 1857 179 
Pahariya and finally to the fort in Rohtashgarh. We kept up our efforts 
to defeat the British. Negotiating the mountainous road we marched 
towards Riwa via Rapatganj (Robertsganj) and Daramadganj. But we 
were neither allowed to stay in Riwa nor allowed to leave. That was why 
we decided to go to Banda where we spent nearly one and a half 
months. At Banda rebel soldiers from other regions also gathered. The 
group included those soldiers as well who had come down from 
Fatehpur along the Grand Trunk road. There was also one company 
made up of Indian soldiers belonging to the 52nd Platoon. It is difficult to say whether the Rajit Baba who is worshipped 
in many parts of Bihar is the same Raj it Ram or not but it is clear 
that a soldier belonging to the backward caste with this name has 
documented his personal experiences of the 1857 rebellion. Another mail of Allen describes the roles of four bhangi rebels 
belonging to the Arrah and Shahabad region. This fact about the 
presence of the four bhangis also emerges from the narrative of 
one Barkandaj, a low rank local level intelligence agent, whose 
evidence dated May 31, 1858 is recorded in the Dumrao police 
station. His evidence states that four bhangis were active during 
the rebellion whose names caused panic among the British 
{Vidrohi 1989: 37]. II 
RURAL NORTH INDIA AND THE STORY OF 1857 It is interesting to know that the 1857 episode is still popular 
in northern India's predominantly dalit villages. The rebellion 
was concentrated in the north Indian Gangetic belt beginning 
from Delhi to Bengal. It began in Meerut on May 10 after news 
spread that the garrisons in Delhi had revolted and expelled the 
British. This acted as a catalyst that saw a great deal of activity 
on the part of the civil population. It soon spread to other parts 
of UP.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=205

spread that the garrisons in Delhi had revolted and expelled the 
British. This acted as a catalyst that saw a great deal of activity 
on the part of the civil population. It soon spread to other parts 
of UP. On May 20 it started in Aligarh, on May 23 in Etawah and 
Mainpuri and May 27 in Etah [Mukherjee 2001: 65]. In this way 
it moved to other parts of UP and Bihar like Kanpur, Awadh, 
Benaras, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Gonda, Bahraich, Sitapur, 
Ghazipur, Sultanpur, western Bihar and finally to Bengal. In 
upper India it was more in the form of a turbulent agrarian 
upheaval gathering together a wide variety of discontents. The 
rebellion had not yet taken the form of an organised movement 
against the British but it commanded extensive popular
180 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
support, especially in Awadh, throughout the North-Western 
Provinces and western Bihar. Sepoy discontent was an essential 
ingredient of the rebellion but the mutiny derived its strength 
from the civil population [Metcalf 1990: 60). Peasants, political 
sadhus [Pinch 1996: 9], local kings and most importantly the 
conservative sections of society, who had suffered greatly under 
the British rule, were united in fighting colonialism. The British 
government put up a stiff resistance to the rebellion. Their 
retribution was harsh and deadly. Village after village was burnt 
or felled with cannon balls to squash the rebellion. Thousands 
of rebels were hanged from the gallows and an equally large 
number were hanged from trees as instant punishment. Although the rebellion ultimately failed it helped develop a 
consciousness about colonialism within the people, especially 
of the Awadh region of UP where the rebellion was most intense. It could also be said to be the beginning of a rennaissance in the 
Hindi-speaking region of India. The rebellion left a deep 
imprint in the minds of the common people that was very 
different from the scanty recorded history of that period. Recorded history only told the stories of rich feudal landlords, 
and kings and queens like Rani Laxmibai and Tatya Tope. The 
stories of unsung heroes who played their role behind the 
curtains of written history were circulated only in oral history in 
rural north India. This fact gave a lot of freedom to dalit 
intellectuals to pick out their own heroes of the rebellion and 
build up their images as dalit icons. These icons were then used 
to construct the identity of grassroots dalits who had no heroes 
or icons to identify with.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=206

DALITS AND MEMORIES OF 1857 The dalits have an emotional link with the 1857 war of 
independence for they believe that it was initiated by them. They claim that the soldier's revolt by the mostly dalit Indian 
soldiers in the British army that took place in Jhansi in 1857, 
snowballed into the war of independence. It was a war of 
independence since the dalits were fighting for their motherland 
rather than seeking power. The war was led by Bhau Bakshi and
Reactivating the Past: Dalits and Memories of 1857 181 
Puran Kori and with them was Jhalkaribai who fought bravely 
against the British for the sake of her motherland [Dinkar 1990: 
62]. The dalit narrative of the ""first"" freedom struggle is filled 
with stories about brave women martyrs belonging to sup­
pressed communities like Jhalkaribai, Avantibai, Udadevi and 
Mahaviridevi [Ibid: 27]. According to them, the 1857 war of 
independence, which the elites claim was started by Mangal 
Pandey, was actually inspired by Matadin Bhangi. The story is 
narrated in such a manner that Matadin Bhangi emerges as the 
source of inspiration for the revolt. Their narrative is as follows: There was a factory in Barrackpore where cartridges were manu­
factured. Many of the workers of this factory belonged to the un­
touchable communities. One day one of the workers felt thirsty. He 
asked a soldier for a mug of water. That soldier was Mangal Pandey. Mangal Pandey, a brahmin, refused him water because the worker 
was an untouchable. This was very humiliating for the worker. He retaliated to the brahmin soldier saying, ""Bara awa hai brahaman 
ka beta. Jin kartuson ka tum upayog karat ho, unpar gaaye or suar ki 
charbi lagawal jaat hai, jinhe tum apan daatun se torkar banduk 
mein bharat ho. 0 samay tomhar jati aur dharam kahan jawat. Dhikkar tumhare is brahmanatwa ka"" [You claim to be a highly 
respectable brahmin, hut the cartridges which you bite with your teeth 
and insert in your guns, are all rubbed with the fat of cows and pigs. What happens to your caste and religion then?",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=207
208,"Jin kartuson ka tum upayog karat ho, unpar gaaye or suar ki 
charbi lagawal jaat hai, jinhe tum apan daatun se torkar banduk 
mein bharat ho. 0 samay tomhar jati aur dharam kahan jawat. Dhikkar tumhare is brahmanatwa ka"" [You claim to be a highly 
respectable brahmin, hut the cartridges which you bite with your teeth 
and insert in your guns, are all rubbed with the fat of cows and pigs. What happens to your caste and religion then? Curse on your 
brahminism] Hearing this soldier was taken by surprise. That untouchable was none 
other than Matadin Bhangi, who opened the eyes of the Indian 
soldier and ignited the first spark of India's independence in the 
cantonment. The words ofMatadin Bhangi spread like wildfire through 
the cantonment. Very soon the torch of independence was lighted. On the morning of March 1, 1857, Mangal Pandey broke the line 
during the parade. Accusing the British of spoiling their religious 
sentiments, he started firing indiscriminately at them. This was the 
moment when the first battle lines against the British were drawn. Mangal Pandey was arrested in an injured condition. He was court­
martialed, and in 1857 hanged from the gallows before all the 
soldiers. Mangal Pandey's sacrifice became an inspiration for all the 
soldiers. On May 10, 1857, the floodgates of the independence 
movement burst in Barrackpore in which many brave sons of 
India became martyrs. In the chargesheet that was made, the first 
name was that of Matadin Bhangi, who was later arrested. All the
182 
1857: Essays fom Economic and Political Weekry 
arrested revolutionaries were court-martialed. Matadin was 
charged for treason against the British [Dinkar op cit: 37]. Nath (1998) in his book 1857 Ki Kranti Ka Janak: Nagvanshi 
--Bhangi Matadin Hela also narrates a similar story in which 
Matadin Bhangi has been claimed to be the father ('janak') of the 
1857 rebellion. In these narratives, Matadin Bhangi is presented 
as the moving force behind the 1857 revolt. They show how the 
forward classes refused to hand a glass of water to the untouch­
ables although they bit cartridges greased with beef fat. Thus, 
these narratives, along with a description of the nationalist 
movement, questions the hierarchical structure of the Indian 
society. The rigid structure in which the untouchables are not 
allowed to go near the forward castes because of their low birth 
and ritual ""dirtiness"" has been strongly criticised. To prove the 
historicity of this event, a book written by one Shri Acharya 
Bhagwan Deb called The Immortal Revolutionaries of India, has 
been quoted by Dinkar [Dinkar op cit: 38]. The memory of Matadin Bhangi and his contribution to the 
nationalist movement is celebrated in a number of ways by the 
dalits.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=208

sung in rallies and functions, both cultural and political. Plays 
are staged at commemorative functions held in his honour in 
towns and villages. Special issues of magazines are brought out 
with articles by eminent writers highlighting his contributions. A 
fortnightly newspaper Dalit Kesri published a special issue on 
the 1857 revolf1 in which the lead article was on Matadin Bhangi. Anarya Bharat, another dalit newspaper that is published from 
Mainpuri in UP, brought out a special feature on the contribu­
tiol'l. of dalits to the 1857 revolt. In all these publications they 
projected Matadin Bhangi as a pioneer of the ""First War of 
Indian Independence"". Himayati, a dalit literary magazine, in its 
May 1996 issue celebrating the memory of 1857 published a 
special feature and lead article on the contribution of Matadin 
Bhangi. Sohanpal Sumanakshar wrote very strongly in the same 
issue that the first person who sowed the seed of the 1857 
revolution was Matadin Bhangi but unfortunately historians 
have forgotten his contribution. 4 In this manner, the elite nationalist history has been sub­
verted by the dalits in their favour. Kuar Singh, Tatya Tope and 
Nana Saheb do not figure in the dalit narrative of the 1857
Reactivating the Past: Dalits and Memories of 1857 183 
freedom struggle. The people who figure are Jhalkaribai, 
Udadevi, Avantibai, Mahaviridevi, Pannadhai, Chetram Jatav, 
Ballu Mehtar, Banke Chamar and Vira Pasi, who were born in 
the lower stratas of society. Although the elite nationalist heroes 
are not negated, they are completely ignored. Their emphasis 
is on the sacrifice of the dalit martyrs for the nation in spite of 
their low birth and poor socio-economic status. Their brave 
confrontation with the British has also been highlighted. The 
story of Balluram Mehtar and Chetram J atav has been 
described in the following manner: Although the dalits were born in the lowest caste of the Indian caste 
hierarchy and suffered great hardship because of their poor socio­
economic status, they never sold themselves for their country. No one 
can accuse a single dalit of doing so. Whenever the need arose, they 
sacrificed their lives for their motherland.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=209

country, the names ofBalluram Mehtar and ChetramJatav are written 
in shining letters. As soon as the news of the Barrackpore revolution 
reached the people, a mob of revolutionaries took to the streets. Phillips, who was an officer of the Eta district, tried to control the mob. On May 26, 1857, in the Soro region ofEta district, ChetramJatav and 
Balluram Mehtar joined into the Barrackpore revolution without caring 
for their lives. In this revolution, Sadashiv Mehre, Chaturbhuj Vaish, etc, 
were also present. ChetramJatav and Balluram, who were the moving 
forces behind the revolution, were tied to trees and shot. The rest were 
hanged from trees in the Kasganj area [Dinkar op cit: 56]. The bravery of the mart}T Banke Chamar is also described. He lived in village Kuarpur, Macchli Shahar, districtjaunpur. When the revolution failed, the British declared Banke Chamar 
and 18 of his associates as 'baghi' (revolutionaries). Banke 
Chamar was ordered to be hanged after being arrested. Thus 
this brave revolutionary laid down his life for the country 
[Dinkar op cit: 59]. Amar Shaheed Vira Pasi is another dalit who is remembered 
as a brave warrior in the dalit narrative. He was a security guard 
of Raja Beni Madhav Singh of Murar Mau, in Rae Bareli, Uttar 
Pradesh. Raja Beni Madhav Singh was arrested for taking part 
in the revolt. One night, Vira Pasi entered the prison and helped 
the king escape. This was a big insult to the British administra­
tion. They decided to capture Vira Pasi dead or alive, and 
placed a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head. However, they were 
unable to capture him [Dinkar op cit: 64]. 184

cantonment. On August 4, 1857 the same battalion came to the 
village, this time with a lot of preparations. When the pasis of 
Magarwara tried to stop them from moving forward a battle 
ensued and nearly 2,000 pasis were killed [Pasi 1998: 34]. Yet another story narrated by the pasis is situated in village 
Bani on the banks of the river Sai, close to Magarwara. This 
region consisted of many small pasi hamlets. When the British 
army passed by this highway it faced a stiff resistance from the 
pasis. Angered by this, the British officers asked the pasis to 
vacate the area within five minutes. When they refused, the 
British announced that they would blow up the hamlets with 
cannons. This caused great alarm, they did try to escape but in 
spite of this many pasis were killed in the cannon firing. The 
British found this region very salubrious and decided to build a 
fort where their soldiers, who had faced stiff resistance by the 
pasis after leaving Kanpur cantonment, could rest and restore 
their vigour. This story is a part of the collective memory and 
oral tradition of the pasis of that region and is often presented 
in plays and songs. The song is: 
Bani bani kati bani, ban ke bigri bani 
Angrezon ke tope se urhi, phir bani rahi bani. (The village Bani was made, then destroyed, 
again made and again destroyed; 
the cannon balls of the British blew it apart, 
then Bani was once again made and remained Bani.) The story is further narrated that the next day general 
Havelock once again moved forward with his troops to free the 
soldiers trapped in the residency. Once again he had to face the 
wrath of Indian freedom fighters, this time at the Alambagh 
Bhavya Bhawan. Many soldiers, both Indian and British lost 
their lives in this battle. When the general reached Dilkushabagh, 
he again had to fight against the Indian rebels. These

oral memory of the dalits. ·N Another story that is narrated in glowing terms is about the 
husband of U dadevi, Makka Pasi who, like his wife, laid down 
his life in the revolt. The incident took place onjune 10, 1857, 
when a small battalion of British soldiers under the leadership 
of Henry Lawrence was passing through Barabanki on their way 
to Chinhat from Awadh. At village Chinhat, Makka Pasi 
gathered an army of 200 pasis and killed many British soldiers. Seeing a danger in him, Lawrence shot Makka Pasi to stop him 
from killing more soldiers. In pasi hagiography it is claimed that 
U dadevi and Makka Pasi are the only couple in world history 
where both the partners have become martyrs. This couple 
elevated the glory of not just the pasi community but the entire 
country [Pasi 2005: 90-91]. IV 
NARRATIVE, IDENTITY AND SEARCH OF LOCATION The dalits, through their narratives of 1857, have not only 
tried to establish their own heroes, but also tried to dethrone the 
existing high-caste heroes from the mainstream narratives. The 
narratives portray the high castes as traitors, conspirators, and 
dishonest to their motherland. Through these narratives, they 
also want to prove that the upper castes, by capturing history 
and the political scene now appear as the most nationalist 
of communities. Through the story of Jhalkaribai also, who was said to have 
fought alongside (Rani) Laxmi Bai, the dalits want to prove that 
the queen was hungry for power. She did not want to revolt 
against the British. It was only under the influence of Jhalkaribai 
that she agreed to do so. At the end of the 1857 struggle, she did 
not become a martyr but hid herself in the estate of Pratapgarh. 5 The historicity of these narratives is questionable but the 
politics behind the creation and narration of these stories is to

establish their own heroes as freedom fighters. The third is to 
prove that zamindars, feudal lords, and the wealthy classes of the 
society were conspirators aiding the British. The educated 
Indian intelligentsia is also claimed to be conspirators aiding the 
British. In the preface of his booklet Sepoy Mutiny 1857-58: An 
Indian Perfidy, AK Biswas (1997:22), a dalit from West Bengal 
who later became an IAS officer, wrote: 
The Indian history has been subjected to calculated distortion at the 
hands of educated Indians. Instances are galore in many walks of life. The Sepoy Mutiny (1857-58) though not even two centuries old and 
though there is vast mass of contemporary literature, has suffered the 
same mindless perversion, truth has been swept under the carpet. In 
other words, it has not been allowed to come to the light. The Sepoy 
Mutiny is hailed today universally as the first war of Indian indepen­
dence when the mutineers unfurled the banner of revolt against a 
mighty empire. The contemporary literature, however, gives a very 
different, rather baffling, picture, the sepoys have been held therein as 
seditious, perfidious, evil and wrong doers, etc. They were condemned 
in strongest terms by Indian journalists ... The feudal class, on the other 
hand lent strong moral and material support to the imperial forces 
which crushed the uprising. The glaring contradiction does not find 
any mention in the textbooks of history of our times for reasons not far 
to seek, nor is it known to the generation of the day. These narratives of the past are being used by the dalits to 
acquire power in the ongoing social struggle. They are also 
attempting to reshape the fractured and competing pasts from 
the present and acquire a position of authority for all the dalit 
castes. This process of remaking the past is based on their 
contemporary socio-political and cultural experience of dis­
crimination which they face in their everyday lives. They link 
their experiences of recent times with their remote past and 
authenticate the latter by establishing their historicity. Invention 
of history for the dalits is thus .a process of acquiring legitimacy 
for their identity by establishing the oldness of the tradition of 
sacrifice by their community for the nation and society.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=213

authenticate the latter by establishing their historicity. Invention 
of history for the dalits is thus .a process of acquiring legitimacy 
for their identity by establishing the oldness of the tradition of 
sacrifice by their community for the nation and society. In this 
sense one can propose that the past can be an authority but the
Reactivating the Past: Dalits and Memories of 1857 187 
nature of this authority is seen as shifting, amorphous and 
amenable to intervention. V 
RECONSTRUCTING HISTORIES AND POLITICS OF FUTURE Why is it important for the dalits to link themselves with the 
1857 war of independence and why are the icons related with 
this incident more important than those of other incidents? Why 
is 1857 so important for them? The reason may be that the 
events around this period are not well documented, so the dalits 
find plenty of space to invent their history and posit their leaders 
in them. To the common people especially the dalits, the 1857 
revolt is highly romantic with a number of local heroic charac­
ters who fought valiantly against the British using indigenous 
weapons. This notion provides the opportunity to create heroes 
belonging to their community with whom they can identify. The 
authenticity of these heroes is debatable but they have the 
power to stir the imagination of people. The events that took 
place in the 20th century on the other hand are very well 
documented since the leaders of that period tried to build up a 
unified homogeneous story of India's independence. This gave 
little space to the dalits since the story is dominated by upper­
caste leaders whom they had to follow. It is true that many lower 
castes lost their lives in the non-cooperation, Quit India and 
other such movements but the glory went to the upper-caste 
leaders who had organised them. The 1857 movement was mainly confined to the northern 
part of India, which made it easier for the dalits of this region in 
search for heroes, to invent and situate their heroes in places 
with heavy concentration of lower castes like Awadh, 
Bundelkhand and Bhojpur. The memory of these events are not 
just part of dalit memory but also a part of the broader collective 
memory of the region that is reflected in the songs, plays and 
other mediums of popular culture. This fact enabled the dalits 
to invent their heroes and histories who could become both 
local heroes and identity markers for the entire community in its 
everyday struggle for dignity and self-respect.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=214

understood that it was of paramount importance to link them­
selves with the nationalist narrative and assert their role in the
188 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week(y 
freedom struggle. However they found it difficult to find space 
in the main phase of the freedom movement since in the period 
when the struggle for dalit uplift picked up momentum, their 
leader B R Ambedkar had developed a rift with Gandhi, the 
most important leader of this phase. Thus there was no option 
but to search for their heroes in the 1857 revolution so as not to 
antagonise the state, which legitimised the nationalist narrative. Since one of the catalysts for the emergence of a dalit nationalist 
narrative was the dialogue with the state, they could not afford 
to ignore it. They could neither negate Ambedkar and his 
narrative of the nationalist movement nor the dominant nation­
alist narrative which is projected as the foundation of the present 
state. The need to strike a balance between the two led the dalits 
to search for their own heroes within the nationalist narrative. And the event which provided them the space to do so was the 
1857 struggle. Another reason why dalits found it crucial to link themselves 
with the 1857 struggle was to counter the allegations made by 
some intellectuals associated with the BJP that the dalits were 
anti-national. According to these intellectuals, Ambedkar was 
against the mainstream nationalist movement led by Gandhi 
and often supported the British. These ideologues try to belittle 
dalits by stating that they conquered India for the British - the 
dusadhs and baheliyas fought for Lord Clive in the Battle of 
Plassey in 17 57. 6 In a bid to oppose the efforts of the dalits to 
write their own history and rupture the mainstream nationalist 
narrative, the All India History Compilation Project, formed by

dalits were compelled to assert their role in the 1857 revolt. They 
stated that their association with 1857 gave them an exalted 
position in the history oflndia's nation-building. That there was 
a difference in opinion among the members of the BJP-RSS was 
obvious when the governor of UP Suraj Bhan, in the same 
convention rebuked those attempting to deny the role of dalits 
in the freedom struggle and said that they had contributed to the

added that but for Valmiki, the writer of Ramayana who 
belonged to a dalit community, no one would have known about 
Rama and Sita. He also mentioned the name ofjhalkaribai who 
in the guise of Rani of Jhansi, fought valiantly against the British 
in the first war of independence.8

MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AND COMPETING POLITICS From a study of the scattered information available and 
narratives that appear in the folk tales and folk lore of the lower 
castes it is evident that many people of these castes were actively 
involved in 1857. In fact the massive scale on which the 
rebellion was launched could not have been possible without 
the participation of these castes, but it is disheartening to note 
that their contribution has neither been documented nor ac­
knowledged in Indian history writing. Whatever little mention there is of the role of the lower castes, 
it is only as servants of kings, feudal landlords and zamindars, 
which has either negated their contribution or marginalised 
them from the history of the rebellion [Rai 2005]. It is true that 
the story of Jhalkaribai is linked with that of Laxmibai and 
Udadevi's with that of Begum Hazrat Mahal, but at a time when 
most of the kings and landlords were joining forces with the 
British to seek benefits from them, it is imperative to evaluate 
the roles of these brave lower caste warriors in the right 
historical context.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=216

rebellion against the British the dalits played a sterling role 
along with the upper caste kings, queens and landlords. In 
addition dalit historians cite many examples of lower caste 
heroes who were not associated with any upper caste king or 
queen but fought against the British in their own capacity 
[Dinkar op cit]. Many extreme Ambedkarite and leftist journal­
ists and scholars who are trying to link the rebellion with 
dissatisfied feudal lords, kings, soldiers and peasants are trying 
to negate the role of dalits in it [Kumar 2002: 12]. Dalit 
intellectuals supported by BSP, which is trying to mobilise 
grassroot dalits using local heroes, histories, myths and legends 
found a wealth of resources in the oral history of the regions of
190

UP where several events of the 1857 occurred [Narayan 2006]. The political strategy of the party is to tell and retell the stories 
of these heroes, build memorials and organise celebrations 
around their stories repeatedly to build a collective memory in 
the psyche of the people. The stories are narrated in such a 
manner that the dalits play the more significant role. Several

their role in the nation-making process the marginalised com­
munities put forward a moral logic in favour of reservations and 
social justice for themselves. They contend that though they had 
shed their blood and sweat for building of this nation and in 
spite of their historical role in its development, the state has not 
helped them to recover from their social, cultural and economic 
losses. Through these narratives they assert that their role in the 
recorded history of nation-making has not been sufficiently 
acknowledged and their contribution in the freedom struggle 
has been completely ignored [Dinkar op cit: 23]. Dalit politicians and dalit intellectuals are using history, 
memories and icons of 1857 in their discourses in various ways. First, when caste conferences are organised as a step towards 
identity construction, they publish posters and handbills in 
which the contribution of their caste heroes in the 1857 struggle 
is mentioned.9 Second, they justify their demands from the state 
as reward for their role in the 1857 movement. 10 Third, during 
election campaigns the BSP leaders highlight the contribution of 
those heroes of the 1857 movement who belong to the caste 
which they are addressing. Fourth, many castes, in their mass 
struggle against the prejudices harboured by the state publish 
posters and pamphlets in which they mention their role in the 
1857 freedom struggle. Many castes are still considered criminal 
tribes on the basis of old colonial acts that continue to be 
followed by the police although they have now been abolished. Such castes say that, when the upper castes were busy

collaborating with the British to earn titles of Rai Bahadur and 
grabbing land that belonged to dalit ancestors, they (the dalits) 
were fighting against the British. In anger, the British branded 
them as criminal tribes under the Criminal Tribe Acts of 1871, 
1896, 1901-02, 1909, 1911, 1913-14, 1919 and 1924.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=218

these tribes have now been denotified, whenever a criminal 
activity takes place, the police, acting on preconceived notions, 
first arrests members of these tribes [Dinkar op cit]. As a protest 
against this kind of state atrocities, these communities continue 
to organise protests and publish posters and handbills in which 
they mention their role in the 1857 movement. Thus in very many ways the memory of 1857 is still alive in 
the collective psyche of the dalits which inspires them in their 
struggle against the everyday social, economic and political 
exclusion and discrimination that they face. NOTES

Dalit 'Viranganas' and Reinvention of 1857 
Cham Gupta THE past three decades particularly have seen a flourishing of 
popular dalit literature, pamphlets and booklets, which have 
emerged as a critical resource for deeper insights into dalit 
politics and identity. Dalits themselves are disentangling re­
ceived knowledge from the apparatus of control. This literature 
brings fresh hope, as it is believed that now dalits are in charge 
of their own images and narratives, witness to and participants 
in their own experience. They are rescuing dalit culture from 
degeneration and stereotypes, and bringing in a new dalit 
aesthetic. They are not the ""Other"", and are themselves articu­
lating critical questions of choice and difference. Most of this literature is mass produced in thousands, usually 
in the form of thin pamphlets.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=220

degeneration and stereotypes, and bringing in a new dalit 
aesthetic. They are not the ""Other"", and are themselves articu­
lating critical questions of choice and difference. Most of this literature is mass produced in thousands, usually 
in the form of thin pamphlets. It is sold in large quantities 
through small ad hoe stalls put up at various public rallies, 
conglomerations and melas of dalits, on pavements, and through 
dalit presses and publishers, reaching through such commercial 
networks into a large number of dalit households. Most of the 
authors are not known much or well established. There is a 
technical lack of sophistication in the production of these 
pamphlets, and they are usually thin, reproduced with many 
editions, priced very cheaply at approximately between Rs 2 
and Rs 50, printed on cheap paper, through private dalit presses. They are written in simple colloquial Hindi, and encompass 
various literary genres. 1 
While covering a huge range, from works by and on Ambedkar, 
status of dalits and atrocities on them, reservations, conversions, 
dalit literary writings, theatre and songs, what interests me here 
are the representations of nationalist struggle in this literature. It 
has been argued that dalits have had an ambivalent relationship 
with both Indian nationalism and colonialism, often
194 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
contradictory with the views of dominant Hindu communities. Some dalit intellectuals argue that the British liberated the dalit 
masses from the oppressions of Hindu society, and that British 
rule was good for the dalits. In Uttar Pradesh, many of the 
activists within the dalit movement had articulated similar ideas 
as early as the 1920s. For example, the Adi-Hindu movement in 
the 1920s and 1930s and its leaders were against the Congress 
and the national movement, and were pro-British. However, in 
post-independent India, given the imperative political asser­
tions by the dalits, there has been a need felt to assert the 
nationalist credentials of the dalits and the positive role they 
played in the freedom struggle. Thus dalit histories have come 
out with copious volumes on their contribution and role in the 
independence movement, digging out hitherto ignored ac­
counts. i The social constructions of the role played by dalits in 
the struggle for India's freedom have thus been changed by the 
dalits themselves in tandem with changing social and political 
conditions in specific historical moments within dalit communi­
ties.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=221

an anti-nationalist or a pro-nationalist stance in the colonial 
period, their agendas and articulations are substantially differ­
ent, departing from and challenging conventional nationalists 
and mainstream historians of the period. Dalit perspectives on 
their own histories offer a dramatically different account from 
the received wisdoms taught in most Indian universities. Promoting alternative accounts of role of dalits in the free­
dom struggle, this literature portrays itself as the real and 
comprehensive truth. It catalogues their enormous sacrifices 
and enumerates the many occasions on which dalits rose in 
defence of the nation. These stories are endlessly repeated in 
pamphlets after pamphlets, though they have not found their 
way in canonised/mainstream history. What is being proposed 
by dalit writers here is the concreteness and the almost palpable 
truth of this history. 3 This popular dalit literature can be seen to 
represent alternative and dissident voices, coexisting with and 
simultaneously challenging hegemonic ideologies. It is a coun­
terpoint to hegemony.4 It also reflects Bakhtin's notions of 
dialogics and heteroglossia,5 and Stuart Hall's concept of 
""oppositional"" decoding, challenging ""dominant-hegemonic"" 
and ""negotiated"" reading positions.6

1857 REVOLT, CONVENTIONAL HISTORIES 
AND DALIT RETELLINGS The revolt of 1857 figures in a major way in the narratives of 
popular dalit histories, where a completely alternative account 
of the revolt emerges, converging histories, myths, realities and 
retelling of the pasts. The outbreak of 1857 has been regarded 
as a memorable episode in Indian history. It was in a sense one 
of the first formidable revolt that had broken out against foreign 
domination. To prove the nationalist credentials of dalits, their 
popular histories have thus completely transformed 1857. Before going into these narratives let us briefly examine 
conventional and standardised histories of the revolt. Various 
strands of historiography largely seem to· converge, particularly on 
the question of the caste character of the revolt. According to 
nationalist historians like S B Chaudhuri, Tara Chand and 
R C Mazumdar, the social composition of 1857 consisted of the 
ruling class and the traditional elite of the society, who were the 
""natural leaders"" of the revolt.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=222

R C Mazumdar, the social composition of 1857 consisted of the 
ruling class and the traditional elite of the society, who were the 
""natural leaders"" of the revolt. The elitist character of the revolt 
is highlighted by referring to it as a general movement of the 
Muslims and the Hindus-princes, landholders, soldiers, scholars 
and theologians.7 Marxist scholars seem to fall within the same 
paradigm where they basically see the revolt as a last attempt of 
the elite medieval order to halt the process of its dissolution and 
recover its lost status. Thomas R Metcalf too emphasises that it was 
not merely a mutiny nor a war of independence. For him 1857 
was ""a traditionalist movement in which those who had the most 
to lose in the new sought the restoration of the old pre-British 
order"". 8 In his significant work, Eric Stokes, while highlighting 
the local background of the upsurge, also argues that it was the fear 
of the loss of an upper caste status due to the use of fat-greased 
cartridges that precipitated the uprising. He shows how ashraf 
Muslims, brahmins and rajputs had secured a near monopoly 
over entry into the Bengal Army and they were afraid of a loss 
to their status. 9 Many other contemporary accounts too emphasise 
the hurt and the fears of pollution felt by upper caste Hindus as 
an important reason for the revolt. How do dalit histories of 1857 
fit in with these accounts? The purity/pollution ties of the upper 
castes and classes, linked with the crossing of seas or biting of 
the flesh of the cow or the pig, do not fit in with dalits. There 
have been other scholars who have emphasised the lower caste
196 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
base of the revolt as well. Thus, for example, Rudrangshu 
Mukherjee emphasises the mutual dependence between peas­
antry and talukdars, which provided the basis for common and 
united action at this tumultuous juncture. He thus links the 
seemingly disjointed and contradictory realms of the elite and 
the common masses. 10 Gautam Bhadra also highlights the 
common leaders of the revolt. II However, even these scholars, 
in spite of their best intentions, do not explicitly focus on dalits 
and even less so on women.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=223

common leaders of the revolt. II However, even these scholars, 
in spite of their best intentions, do not explicitly focus on dalits 
and even less so on women. As Bhadra says, ""In all these 
representations what has been missed out is the ordinary 
rebel, his role and his perception of alien rule and contempo­
rary crisis""I2 ( emphasis in original). With the rise of the dalit movement and literature in north 
India, the history of 1857 however has been completely inversed, 
with many histories of it being rewritten, particularly since the 
1960s. I3 Contemporary dalit perceptions and compositions of 
1857 are very different from scholarly historical studies on the 
subject, or even constructed ""popular"" perceptions, and repre­
sent the historical consciousness of the revolt in the public 
memory of the dalits. The pamphlets and books on dalit 
histories of 1857 - which may also be described as unofficial 
dalit histories of colonial India - combine myths, memories and 
histories, depicting dalit versions of the revolt. Dalit writers are 
attempting here to look upon the mutiny as part of their struggle 
for freedom. The revolt has taken on the character of a dalit 
resistance, where alternative dalit heroes are represented as the 
real symbols of 1857 in dalit popular nationalist consciousness. The rebel dalit heroes - some constructed, some exaggerated, 
some ""discovered"" - have become heroes fighting for a free 
India. In these accounts, the armies of soldiers against British 
consist largely of dalits. New dalit histories argue that the dalits 
had nothing much to lose in pre-British times, as their condition 
had been miserable even then. So it was actually dalits who 
fought for independence in 1857, while the upper caste Hindus 
and Indian rulers only fought to restore their rule. The focus of 
this literature is no longer on the sepoys or the greased car­
tridges, but on dalits groaning under foreign oppression. As the 
famous dalit poet Bihari Lal Harit says regarding 1857: 
nai, dhobi, kurmi, kachchijbharbhuje bhaat kumhaar lare. Lare khak rub mochi dhanak/sab daliton ke parivar lare. Dalit 'Viranganas' and Reinvention of 1857 197

Dalit narratives of 1857 deploy an impassioned language, and 
are written usually by dalit men who are not trained historians. These writers are inspired by altogether different sentiments, 
and their writings reveal the inner dynamics of dalit politics as well. They are writing history with a mission by claiming a past and using 
it for the furtherance of their future. One of their purposes in 
writing inspirational histories of this kind is to stimulate dalit 
nationalism, dalit patriotic sentiment, and their pride. They are 
rewriting history to provide dignity to the dalits. 15 Present day 
feelings are ascribed to dalit heroes of 1857, and they are seen 
as teaching a moral lesson that the dalits of today need to 
emulate the heroic deed of their past heroes, and fight for their 
rights today as well. In the dalit literature, 1857 has become the 
Caesar of India, which is more powerful when dead than alive. It 
has got inscribed as a heroic popular uprising fought by the lowly, 
a symbol of challenge to the British power by the dalits. It entailed 
united dalit activism and sacrifice of enormous numbers. Its 
history is constantly being reshaped in the present socio-cultural 
and political context. It has an inspirational quality, an effective 
conviction, which signifies a present political importance. 1857 has also become a marker for the dalits to prove their 
nationalist credentials, and claim their own space in the freedom 
struggle and the history of a nation in the making. By this, 
dalits also seek to win acceptance from the wider society by 
creating and legitimising a space for themselves within the 
nationalist narratives. w However, these histories are not just 
reinventions of the past or inspirational histories. They also 
reveal a deep impassioned plea to recognise the unsung heroes 
of the revolt, who were often illiterate and left no written records. Folksongs, oral narratives and myths also thus become the basis 
of these accounts. As says one: 
yatra-tatra sarvatra milegi, unki gaatha ki charcha. kintu upekshit veervaron ka 
kabhi nahin chapta parcha. (Here, there and everywhere, you will find discussions on their deeds,

cannon fodder of 1857 history has thus kept dalit versions of 
1857 away from the loci of authority - university departments, 
literary associations and syllabi. Dalit literature on 1857 occu­
pies a different public-political domain and presents an alter­
nate form of knowledge. The language and vocabulary de­
ployed in dalit literature on 1857 stresses the need for dalitisation 
of history and to examine the dalit leaders of the revolt. Dalits 
claim that reinventing 1857 from a dalit perspective is impera­
tive in order to represent reality. While appropriating the past, 
dalit writers are simultaneously questioning the blurred presen­
tations and partial/prejudiced histories of historians, arguing 
that dalit heroes of the revolt have been completely erased by 
them. They argue that most historians implicitly hold their high 
caste biases when writing histories of 1857. 18 
DALIT 'VIRANGANAS' OF 1857 A chief feature of these popular dalit histories of 1857 is the 
way dalit women get represented in them. Here myths about 
dalit viranganas (heroic women) are being reinvented as a 
potent symbol for identity formation and as a critical part of a 
movement to define political and social positioning of dalits. Narratives of dalit viranganas abound, with a long list of them 
littering the Indian past. These women are ascribed particularly 
heroic roles. In fact, dalit female icons, engaged in radical 
armed struggles, far outnumber dalit men in 1857. These writings 
invoke political and public dalit memories, where women like 
Jhalkari Bai of the kori caste, Uda Devi, a pasi, Avanti Bai, a 
lodhi, Mahabiri Devi, a bhangi and Asha Devi, a gutjari, all stated 
to be involved in the 1857 revolt, have become the symbols of 
bravery of particular dalit castes and ultimately of all dalits. 19 
Representing the cJalit woman in certain modes in 1857 also 
indicates ways in which pasts are remembered and retailed, and 
the relationships of such pasts to people's sense of belonging. As 
has been remarked, representation can pose afresh the

ten, transmitted and inscribed, stereotypicality and lived his­

through the lens of representation adds important dimensions to 
our understanding of it, while also revealing tensions between 
the pedagogical and the performative, the rhetoric and the 
reality. Foucault has argued that all representations are by their 
very nature insidious instruments of surveillance, oppression 
and control - both tools and effects of power. However, if we 
argue that representations of dalit women are constructed only 
to support dominant modes of ideology, and that their aim is 
ultimately coercive, then how can we use this space also for 
confrontation? Does representation have the scope of carving 
out more contingent, varied and flexible modes of 
resistances? 21 Within the field of representation, counter-images 
can emerge, challenging hegemonic images. In India, there have been a significant number of studies 
concerned with the representations of high caste, middle class 
women, particularly of the colonial period. 22My own earlier 
work had focused on this. 23While significant in their own right, 
there is an implicit implication in these works that since dalit 
women fall within the category of ""women"", their representation 
need not be singled out for a separate study. Thus, portrayal of 
dalit women of the colonial period as a major area of feminist 
scholarly examination has remained negligible and on the 
fringes. Dalit literature on 1857 provides us a significant mo­
ment to examine alternative representations of dalit women. It 
can be an important source of insight into gender politics from 
a dalit perspective and a site of struggle over meanings. While 
highlighting the centrality of these dalit viranganas in the 
symbolic constitution of dalit identity, this literature simulta­
neously reveals a world turned upside down, challenging tex­
tual, academic and historical narratives of 1857. It further shows 
how resistance to dominant discourses about dalit women has 
been coded and lived by various groups of dalits within dalit 
communities at different historical moments.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=227

emerge here as not only visible, but as conspicuous and central 
characters, and objects of attention and adulation. Thus for example, to take the case ofjhalkari Bai, there has 
been a proliferation of a vast number of popular Hindi tracts,
200 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
written by various authors, and cultural invocations on her, 
including comics, poems, plays, novels, biographies, 
'nautankis', 24 and even magazines and organisations in her 
name. To name just a few, there is the comic Jhalkari Bai; 
poems variously titled Virangana Jhalkari Bai Kavya, Jhansi ki 
Sherni: ViranganajhalkariBai kajeevan Charitra and Virangana 
Jhalkari Bai Mahakavya; plays and nautankis called Virangana 
Jhalkari Bai and Achhut Virangana Nautanki; novels and bio­
graphies like Virangana Jhalkari Bai and Achhut Virangana; 
and a magazine calledjhalkari Sandesh, published from Agra.25 
Various dalit magazines have published articles on her. 26 
Similarly, on U da Devi, there are poems, plays, stories and 
magazines penned and narrated on various occasions. 27 The various narratives go something like this. Jhalkari Bai 
is depicted as an 'amar shaheed' (immortal martyr) of 1857, 
belonging to the kori caste. Jhalkari Bai hailed fromjhansi. Her 
husband Puran Kori was an ordinary soldier in the kingdom of 
raja Gangadhar Rao. Jhalkari Bai is depicted as an ideal woman, 
occasionally helping her husband in his traditional occupation 
of cloth weaving, and also sometimes accompanying him to the 
royal palace. She is stated to be brave since her childhood and 
further got training from her husband in archery, wrestling, 
horse-riding and shooting. Her face and body structure is said 
to resemble Lakshmibai exactly. Slowly Jhalkari Bai and 
Lakshmibai become friends. Jhalkari was entrusted with the 
charge of leading the women's wing of the army, known as the 
""Durga Dal"". When the 1857 revolt began, the rulers were 
mostly interested in just saving their thrones and it was not a 
freedom struggle for them. It was dalits who made it a freedom 
struggle. When the British besieged the fort of Jhansi, Jhalkari 
Bai fought fiercely.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=228

Unnao gate. Her husband died while fighting with the British 
and when Jhalkari Bai heard this, she became a ""wounded 
tigress"". She killed many British, and managed to hoodwink 
them for a long time, before they discovered her true 
identity. 28 According to some versions, suddenly many bullets 
hit her, and she died. 29 Some state that she was set free, lived till 
1890 and became a legend of her time.30
Dalit 'Viranganas' and Reinvention of 1857 201 
U da Devi is said to have been born in the village Ujriaon of 
Lucknow. She was also known as Jagrani and was married to 
Makka Pasi. She became an associate of Begum Hazrat Mahal, 
and Uda formed a women's army, with herself as the com­
mander. Her husband became a martyr in the battle at Chinhat. Uda decided to take revenge. When the British attacked Sikandar 
Bagh in Lucknow under Campbell, he was faced with an army 
of dalit women: 
koi unko habsin kehta, koi kehta neech achchut. abla koi unhein batlaye, koi kahe unhe majboot. (Some called them black African women, some untouchable. Some 
called them weak, others strong.)31 It is significant here that even W Gordon-Alexander's account 
of the storming of Sikandar Bagh by British troops states: In addition ... there were ... even a few amazon negresses, amongst the 
slain. These amazons having no religious prejudices against the use of 
greased cartridges, whether of pigs' or other animal fat, although 
doubtless professed Muhammadans, were armed with rifles, while the 
Hindu and Muhammadan East Indian rebels were all armed with 
musket; they fought like wild cats, and it was not till after they were 
killed that their sex was even suspected. 2 
Uda Devi was one of them, who is said to have climbed over 
a 'pipal' tree and shot dead, according to some accounts 32 and 
some 36, British soldiers. One soldier spotted someone in the 
tree and shot the person dead, and only then it was discovered 
that she was a woman. Realising her brave feat, even British 
officers like Campbell bowed their heads over her dead body 
in respect.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=229

Asha Devi Gurjari is portrayed as a leader to a large number 
of young girls and women and it is stated that on May 8, 1857, 
she along with a large number of other women like Valmiki 
Mahaviri Devi, Rahimi Gurjari, Bhagwani Devi, Bhagwati Devi, 
Habiba Gurjari, Indrakaur, Kushal Devi, Naamkaur, Raajkaur, 
Ranviri Valmiki, Seheja Valmiki and Shobha Devi attacked the 
British army and died while fighting. 34 Narratives on Avanti Bai 
claim to combine history and literature. She was the queen of 
Ramgarh, and belonged to the lodhi community of Mandia 
district in Madhya Pradesh. In 1857, she too faced the oppres­
sion of the British. She retaliated and fought fiercely. When she
202 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week9' 
was surrounded by British soldiers, she decided to kill herself 
rather than surrender to them. Her last death wish was that the 
British should leave the Indian soil and return to their country. 35 
Mahabiri Devi belonged to the bhangi caste and lived in the 
village Mundbhar in the district of Muzaffarnagar. Though she 
was uneducated, she was very intelligent and opposed exploi­
tation of any kind from an early age. She was born for the poor 
and fought for them. Slowly her fame spread. Mahabiri Devi 
made an organisation of women whose aim was to stop women 
and children from being involved in 'grihnit karya' (dirty work) 
and to live with dignity. In 1857, she made a group of22 women 
and attacked the British. She fought bravely and killed many 
British. Finally she herself was killed by them and along with her 
22 other unknown women died. She will always remain a source 
of inspiration. 36 
Certain features stand out in these various narratives. Many 
of them claim to be centred around neglected dalit women 
warriors specifically, whose marginalisation cannot be tolerated 
by dalits any longer. 37",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=230

Certain features stand out in these various narratives. Many 
of them claim to be centred around neglected dalit women 
warriors specifically, whose marginalisation cannot be tolerated 
by dalits any longer. 37 In all of them, these dalit women are 
depicted as brave from their very childhood, and the 1857 revolt 
becomes the turning point which sparks them to accomplish 
great deeds in the face of high odds. However, the voices of dalit 
viranganas themselves are usually faint discursive threads, as 
their stories of adventure and bravery are narrated through a 
variety of sources - oral, official accounts and dalit male authors. It is these authors who provide narrative coherence, filling in the 
gaps, and slipping into the present tense to add dramatic flourish 
and detail to the stories. The past and the present blur and 
mingie to provide a cohesive narrative of dalit oppression and 
the bravery of these women against all odds. Many of these dalit 
viranganas become the symbols of pride for one particular dalit 
caste. Thus Uda Devi is revered by the pasis particularly, and 
has emerged as a symbol of Pasi honour, dignity, pride, 
mobilisation and rights. 38 On the other hand, Jhalkari Bai has 
been appropriated, eulogised and celebrated by all dalit groups, 
irrespective of divisions between them, and has become a 
symbol of unity of all dalits. Most of these dalit viranganas have Devi or Bai suffixed to 
their names. They are also projected as highly moral, very 
""noble"", super brave and super nationalist dalit women. They
Dalit 'Viranganas' and Reinvention of 1857 203 
are emblems of shakti. The written and visual images of these 
viranganas in the texts itself and on the cover of these pamphlets 
spectacularise them as usually clad in ""masculine"" attires, with 
their bodies all covered up. They are shown to be expert in 
horse-riding, swimming, bow-arrow and sword fighting. 39Through 
such portrayals, dalits hope to garner greater respect, opportu­
nity and dignity to these viranganas, and through them to all 
dalits. Simultaneously this feeds into conceptions of masculinity. It also covertly challenges notions of dalit female sexuality, and 
can be seen as a reaction to images of sexually immoral dalit 
women. By shunning outward expressions of sexuality, dalit 
women can also hope to build a space where they can wield 
more control over their bodies and gain dignity and respect 
within the dominant culture. Poems and songs occupy a central place in these narratives, 
which eulogise the viranganas. It is interesting that many of these 
narrative poems ('khand kavyas') have cleverly appropriated 
the famous poem written by Subhadrakumari Chauhan on 
]hansi ki Rani Lakshmibai.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=231

given new meanings and completely reinterpreted, they are also 
easy to remember. Thus goes one onjhalkari Bai: 
khub lari jhalkari tu tau, teri ek jawani thi. dur firangi ko karne mein, veeron mein mardani thi. har halon ke much se sun hum teri yeh kahani thi. rani ki tu saathin banker, jhansi fatah karani thi....

CThalkari you really fought, your youthfulness was unique. You were a man among the brave in ousting the British. We heard your story from the mouth of warriors. You pledged forjhansi to be victorious by being a friend of the queen. Jhalkari, you rode from the Datiya gate, trampling the British. You were like the Kali, and your strike was like lightning. As soon as a British raised his head, you struck immediately. We heard your deeds from the warriors, reciting tales of your bravery.)w These songs and poems are often recited in dalit melas and 
rallies, using dance and musical instruments. Plays too are 
enacted around them. 204 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly The main narrative plots have become more elaborate with 
time and many stories have been added on, connected to larger 
purposes of dalit identity. Thus in the Jhalkari Bai story, one 
episode repeatedly narrated is of Jhalkari being blamed for 
killing a cow, which had actually been hidden by a brahmin, but 
the truth is revealed. 41 This story may be linked to challenging 
dominant colonial and Hindu narratives which have regarded 
dalits, along with Muslims, as killers of the ""holy"" cow. Another 
feature of these writings is that as they have grown, they have 
become more ""sure"" in their narrative. Thus for example, the

can discern here a tentativeness or uncertainty regarding the 
role of Rani Lakshmibai in the revolt, where Jhalkari Bai is 
shown to be an accomplice or at most an equal of Lakshmibai. 42 
This has slowly given way to a more sure, authoritative and 
""mature"" dalit history in which Lakshmibai, instead of a model 
nationalist ruler, appears as a weakling, as reluctant to fight the 
British, 43 and in fact, is shown as a British supporter and agent. It is stated that Jhalkari Bai was even worried that Lakshmibai 
might surrender herself to the British as she was very scared of 
war. Challenging myths and histories surrounding Lakshmibai, 
it is argued that in reality Lakshmibai not only managed to 
escape to the forests of Nepal with the help of the ruler of 
Pratapgarh, she died only in 1915 at the age of 80. It is Jhalkari 
Bai who is the real martyr and virangana. It is her name that 
ought to be written in golden letters. She was a dalit woman, with 
no kingdom, no palace, no expensive jewellery, and no silken 
clothes. She was neither a queen nor the daughter of a feudal 
lord, nor the wife of a 'jagirdar'. She fought selflessly, only for 
the love of her country, and thus her sacrifice far surpasses 
anyone else's.44 As a historian, when I started working on these dalit viranganas 
of 1857, what concerned me was the absence of ""hard core"",

to commonly accepted criteria and the absence of stylistic 
models. A multitude of lives that have been cancelled, destined 
to count for nothing, find their symbolic redemption in the 
depiction of immortal characters. 45 But this is not enough. Dalits 
themselves are keen to prove the historical credibility of their 
viranganas, and constantly site sources from literary accounts, 
British narratives, archaeology and oral histories. They claim 
their works to be ""scientific"", ""truthful"", ""detailed"". As says one: 
aithihasik sandarbhon bhitar, ankit sari hai ghatna. nahin kalpana se kalpit hai - amar humari yeh rachna. (The whole incident is noted inside historical sources. This immortal 
story of ours is not a figment of imagination.) 46 
Scattered, often thin, evidence is sited and quoted by dalits 
repeatedly. Thus onJhalkari Bai, a constantly quoted source is 
Vrindavan Lal Varma's Jhansi ki Rani Lakshmibai. It was 
published in 1946 after intense personal research and historical 
reflection, and it mentioned the dusky-complexioned newly 
wed Jhalkari Dulaiya of the kori caste, who bore a striking 
resemblance to the Rani. 47 Vishnu Rao Godse, who is said to 
have been present in the fort when the Rani had fought against 
General Rose, too had made a reference to Jhalkari in his 
Marathi book Majha Pravas (My Travels). Similarly on Uda 
Devi, Amritlal Nagar's Gadar ke Phool and William Forbes­ Mitchell's Reminiscences of the Great Mutiny are often cited. 48 And today these stories stand as given, visible truths, with 
stamps issued in their name, many statues constructed, public 
rallies and meeting organised, celebrations and festivities con­
ducted, and even colleges and medical institutions formed in 
their name. Thus, for example, a huge public rally and a mela 
is organised in Lucknow every year near the statue of U da Devi 
at Sikandar Bagh on November 16, the stated day of her 
martyrdom. 49 With constant evocation, these names have become 
inscribed in popular dalit memories.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=234

integral part of their Hectoral campaigns and mobilisation 
strategies, the most successful being the Bahujan Samaj Party, who 
have used them to build the image of Mayawati particularly. 50 Are these representations of dalit viranganas historical 
fictions or fictive histories or something more? How real, exact 
and truthful in any case are ""official"", canonised histories of 
1857? Scholars have questioned the possibility of any one 
authentic history. 51 Histories of dalit viranganas, who are simul­
taneously dalit and women, stand as persuasive accounts, as 
histories from below, reaching towards their own ""reality"". They 
take recourse to recorded historical events and intermesh it with 
subaltern renderings of lost histories, deracinated by mainstream 
historiography. They are counter-histories of 1857. READING DALIT HISTORIES OF VIRANGANAS These popular histories of dalit viranganas are open to simulta­
neously persuasive, multiple and contradictory readings. There 
are, of course, limitations of this literature as a historical source. Their representation of dalit women too needs to be questioned. Very few dalit women themselves have penned these popular 
pamphlets. It is dalit men who are largely engaged in controlling 
the way images of dalit women are depicted. While these dalit viranganas are portrayed as ""superwomen"", 
full of bravery, and doing ""impossible"" acts, these glorifications 
and celebratory accounts do not extend to all dalit women in 
general. They offer a filtered vision, viewed through the eyes of 
the creators of these images. Victimhood is replaced by a new 
archetype of heroism. Jhalkari Bai is shown as even killing a tiger 
single-handedly. 52 Although empowering, these images are not 
necessarily more representative of dalit women. Further, many 
of these viranganas are physically attractive in their appearance, 
""classic"" beauties, falling into the stereotype offemale beauty. 53 
Simultaneously, there is an assertion of a super moral dalit female 
subject perhaps also allowing dalit men to police the behaviour of 
dalit women in general. Some of these tracts appear didactic in their 
endorsement of certain patriarchal values. They are often replete 
with images of the loyal wife and an ideal mother.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=235

the emergence of popular dalit male literature has not altered
Dalit 'Viranganas' and Reinvention of 1857 207 
much the images of dalit women. Though vastly different in 
their scope, area and portrayals, these presentations codify dalit 
women in certain ways, and fail to offer a more meaningful 
portrayal of them. The representations often remain simplistic, 
rarely revealing the complexity, and dimensionality that make 
up dalit women's life. They offer incomplete projections to 
which not many dalit women can fully relate to. Save for who 
controls the representations, has anything much changed for the 
dalit woman? As has been contended by Bell Hooks, this may 
apply a mere transference, without radical transformation. 54 A 
true liberatory potential may only be realised when dalit women 
themselves can create and represent their own histories and 
images through a collage of identities and sing their own songs. To stop here however would be offering only one side of 
the picture. These women figures can also provide counter­
hegemonic and oppositional perspectives about dalit women 
and about the 1857 revolt. The representation of dalit viranganas 
on a high moral and heroic ground can also be seen as an 
appropriation of respectability and ""credibility"", imparting dalit 
participation in past histories new meanings. These dalit 
viranganas represent dalits in the service of freedom and Indian 
nationalism. Here the subalterns are very much speaking, to 
inverse Spivak's proposition,55 and they are speaking through 
these dalit women viranganas. They are representing their own 
voices. As has been pointed out, ""While Spivak is excellent on 
the 'itinerary of silencing' endured by the subaltern, particularly 
historically, there is little attention to the process by which the 
subaltern's 'coming to voice' might be achieved. ""56 At places the 
achievements of these dalit viranganas are juxtaposed to the 
pathetic conditions of dalit women in general, blaming society 
at large and men as well, stating that in spite of having a 
brave past and being protectors of dalit dignity, dalit women 
have been denied education, have been made slaves, have been 
oppressed by men. 57 
Dalit women too are now trying to use these images in 
multiple ways to their maximum advantage.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=236

Dalit women too are now trying to use these images in 
multiple ways to their maximum advantage. Besides ways in 
which these symbols have helped build up Mayawati, many 
have used these figures to question representations of dalit 
women in general, as well as their oppression and exploitation 
in real life. Thus Meena Pasi stated, ""Uda Devi andjhalkari Bai
208 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
have shown to me that I too can resist all kinds of injustices. I 
do not have to take things lying down. These figures inspire me 
to question why I am getting less wages from the landlord, why 
I am beaten up by my husband when I do equal, if not more, 
work. I can look up to Uda Devi and say that nothing is 
impossible if one has the will to resist and fight"".58These 
representations of dalit women viranganas may thus also be seen 
as ""positive engendering"". 59 They question and disrupt usual 
dominant stereotypes of dalit women, either negatively as 
'kutnis' (evil) and vamps, or as passive victims, powerless and 
subordinated. The centrality of the dalit viranganas in the 1857 
revolt in popular dalit literature provokes reflection on the 
enabling potential for women's real lives of ubiquitous icons of 
dalit feminine power. 60 These images also form a part offeminist 
studies, as instead of focusing on just dalit women's 
""victimisation"", they point to their power and strategies of 
resistance, even though penned largely by men. 61 Here dalit 
women are actors and agents in their own right. They are 
transformed from victims into victors within the context of a 
narrative. Jhalkari Bai, Uda Devi, Mahabiri Devi, and along with 
them many other dalit women, emerge as physically command­
ing and armed, infused with power, strength, bravery, activism 
and sacrifice, locked in violent conflict with the British. It may also be argued that what we are dealing with here is no 
ordinary, academic history. While creating a history of pride, 
through these celebratory accounts dalit writers are accruing for 
themselves a psychic space and harnessing the resources needed 
to hold their own.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=237

thinking, both about 1857 and about dalit women. While it may 
not be inherently radical or transformative, it provides progres­
sive and different readings. Dalit women here are signifiers of 
1857 and through that of dalit identity. These are not just stories 
of brave dalit women but of all dalits, of their legacy, of their 
bravery, of their pride, of their sacrifice in service of the nation. NOTES

In Search of Alternative Histories of 1857: 
Witch-hunts, Adivasis, and the 
Uprising in Chhotanagpur 
Shashank Sinha 
AS an event which shook the foundations of British rule in most 
parts of north India, necessitated large-scale administrative and 
policy changes, and fired the nationalist imagination, 1857 still 
continues to be a relatively under-researched terrain. The initial 
obsession with simplistic epithets like ""sepoy mutiny"", ""war of 
independence"", ""nationalist uprising"" and ""Muslim conspiracy"" 
did subsequently pave way for a exploration of civil, popular 
and organisational aspects [Majumdar 1957; Chaudhuri 1957; 
Sen 1957] as India celebrated 100 years of the ""Great Uprising"". Published the same year, 1857: A Symposium [Joshi 1957] opened 
up tremendous possibilities be examining issues such as the 
background of the rebellion, role of religion and the Wahabais, 
popular culture, social composition and leadership patterns, 
feudal rivalries, and internal contradictions. The enthusiasm 
generated by this centenary volume was soon lost in the absence 
of systematic follow-up writings. The publication of Eric Stokes' 
Peasant and the Raj (1978) and The Peasant Armed (1986); Ranajit 
Guha's Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency in Colonial India 
(1983); and Gautam Bhadra's 'Four Rebels of Eighteen Fifty 
Seven' (1985) in the late 1970s and 1980s marked a significant 
advance in mainstream writing with the inclusion of peasants and 
subaltern issues against the backdrop of factors like mobilisation 
methods, caste, demography, and ecology. These were comple­
mented by two intensive regional studies on the popular dynam­
ics of the revolt in Awadh [Mukherjee 1984] and Bundelkhand 
[Roy 1994].",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=246

214 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
Aligarh Historians Group (a special issue of Social Scientist, Vol 26, 
Nos 1-4, January-April, 1998) to integrate areas like popular 
culture, tribals, literature, alternative sources, and sepoy contin­
gents in the 1857 repertoire. In the opening years of 21st century, 
Rajat Kanta Ray (2003) added another interesting dimension 
to the historiography by an investigation of the mentalities of 
the rebels. When one looks at the last 150 years, writings on 1857 have 
been characterised by some conspicuous gaps and omissions 
in terms of the absence of a sustained and systematic research 
as also the social and geographical space traversed. The historio­
graphy of 1857 has largely been dominated by commemorative 
volumes on general aspects of the rebellion. Areas and characters 
outside the Indo-Gangetic plain still continue to be marginalised 
in the various historical accounts so do adivasis, peasants, dalits, 
and women. With the exception of Awadh and Bundelkhand, 
and to a lesser extent east Punjab, there is a glaring absence of 
to full-length regional studies. The reopening of the debate, in 
the wake of 150 years of the revolt, does indeed offer some 
alternative possibilities in relation to the use of source 
material, historical approaches, and revisiting received wis­
dom. The recent writings do raise questions of popular and 
contemporary interest but old concerns and characters 
largely predominate - Bahadur Shah Zafar, Delhi, Indo-Islamic 
culture, role of Wahabis [as it does with Dalrymple 2006]; 
sepoy mutinies and Mangal Pandey [see Mukherjee 2006]. As 
we celebrate the 150th anniversary there is an even greater 
need to recover some lost ground and expand the social and 
geographical horizons of the debate.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=247

open up a small frontier in a ""little known province of the 
Empire"" - the Chhotanagpur: an area where women were 
involved in the uprising more as victims than as active partici­
pants. Briefly outlining the 1857 experience in the region, 1 this 
introductory piece investigates the occasioning of perhaps the 
first mass witch-hunts among tribal communities of Singhbhum 
and Santhal Paraganas. Within the broader framework of 
social history, it tries to argue that these witch-hunts formed a 
conscious contour of resistance combining both (the obvious) 
gender but also anti-colonial tensions. Witch-hunts, Adivasis, and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur 215 
CIVIL REBELLIONS 
Chhotanagpur offers a brilliant example of the multiple 
contours an event (1857) can take in a region. While sepoy 
mutinies provided the underlying current, there were both inter 
and intra-district variations in the civilian movements. Both the 
sepoy mutinies and the civilian outbreaks had some clear 
interconnections and some linkage or the other with the ""main­
stream"" mutiny. Together they posed a serious challenge to 
colonial rule in the region. Given the geography of the region, 2 
for a short period as the mainstream revolt raged (July-October 
1857), with the involvement of relatively unorganised battal­
ions, and the directorial efforts made by the rebel sepoys, the 
sepoy mutinies, for their part, in Chhotanagpur were more than 
just ""spontaneous"". There was a pattern in the mutinies - with 
sepoy units from Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, Purulia (Manbhum), 
and Singhbhum marching towards the local power centre. The 
modus operandi was also similar: looting the treasury, attacking 
official bungalows and buildings, destroying government records, 
breaking the jails and releasing the prisoners and marching to 
Ranchi. 3Once in Ranchi, the sepoys did make serious efforts to 
enlarge their social base by not only mobilising influential local 
zamindars but also sending emissaries to other districts. On 
August 4, the proclamation of the establishment of 'Padshahi 
Raj' was circulated throughout the district.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=248

August, the rebel administration also called a political con­
ference to resolve potential issues and to deliberate on the 
future course of action [Kumar 1991]. 4 
1857 also triggered off a series of civil rebellions by giving 
vent to many existing tensions and contradictions some of which 
were not predominantly anti-British at the outset. What is 
interesting to note is how they intersected with regional com­
plexities and changing socio-political configurations to acquire 
an anti-colonial context. Herein lay the strength of the ""spirit of 
1857"". It opened up the unresolved Santhal question in 
Hazaribagh and Manbhum. The Santhal 'Hul' was an extended 
movement in which the Santhals of Hazaribagh and Dhanbad 
also participated. While the Santhals of Santhal Parganas region 
had been pacified by the creation of a new district and 
administrative arrangements5 nothing was done to address the
216 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
grievances of their brethren elsewhere. The Santhals of 
Hazaribagh did naturally become excited by the weakening of 
authority and started squaring accounts with oppressive money­
lenders and other perceived oppressors (Roy Choudhury 1959: 
67]. They also attempted to cut off communication between 
Hazaribagh and Ranchi. The Santhals of the Manbhum were 
similarly restive when the sepoys of the Ramgarh Regiment met 
them at Purulia on August 5. They rebelled and attacked the 
zamindar of Jaipur where they looted and murdered many 
(Hazaribagh Old Records, p 97). The Santhal zone of depreda­
tion had in fact become the ""most disturbed part of 
Chhotanagpur"". Known as the ""best-known episode of tribal outbreak in 1857"" 
[Singh 1998: 77], the Chero-Bogta (tribal) uprising in Palamau 
caused a quite a bit of concern for the colonial administration. By end November the ""whole country appeared to be in arms, 
and Lieutenant Graham with his small party, was shut up and 
besieged in the house of Raghubar Dayal ( one of the local feudal 
lords) whilst the rebels were plundering in all directions"" [Roy

Choudhury 1959: 97]. Later in 1858 they were joined by sepoy 
mutineers from Ranchi and Hazaribagh (after the defeat at the 
battle of Chatra) and later by Shahabad rebels from the Kunwar 
Singh and Amar Singh camp. In Singhbhum, there are two distinct phases. The first phase 
(fromjuly-August to November-December 1857) was marked 
by the resurfacing of the traditional rivalry between the Porahat 
and Saraikela families ""transmitted from father to son for several 
generations"" (Roy Choudhury 1959: 78--79]. The latter phase 
(beginning with the attack on Porahat, November 1857 upto 
1861) was characterised by confrontations between the British 
(supported by the 'raja' of Saraikela and Kharaswan) on the one 
hand and Arjun Singh's supporters and large sections of Kols on 
the other. There was a definite discontent among the tribes of 
the region - the system of written oaths, annual visits by the 
commissioner, insistence on regular payment of tax, attempts to 
increase the rate of assessment and to change the mode of 
assessment had led to the creation of a new situation in Kol 
heartland. But whether this discontent did transform into a 
project of direct political opposition or a ""rebellion of the Kols"" 
involving the ""entire community"", as Gautam Bhadra would
Witch-hunts, Adivasis, and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur 217 
have us believe, is something which needs to be examined 
(1985: 259). Bhadra overlooks the methods adopted by Gonoo 
(a tribal leader and a principal adherent of Arjun Singh) and the 
threat of collective violence used by his followers to enforce 
cooperation from vacillating elements within the community. He also underplays the fact that half of the 'mundas' and 
'mankees' (traditional village heads) who had earlier been 
incorporated in the colonial administrative setup (by giving 
them revenue and police powers) remained loyal to their 
colonial masters [ibid: 258]. There were surely other methods of extra-political resistance 
through which the Kols counteracted colonial intrusion.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=250

through which the Kols counteracted colonial intrusion. Bhadra 
does acknowledge elsewhere that ""all administrative regulations 
like the ban on witch-hunts were systematically violated"" during 
the upsurge (Taylor 1996: 84]. He however fails to see this as a 
conscious contour of resistance. Resistance to colonial rule 
among marginal societies was not always very ""direct"" and ""visible"" 
therefore what is required is a shift in focus from ""extraordinary 
moments of collective protest"" to ""variety of non-confrontational 
resistances and contestatory behaviour"" [Haynes and Prakash 
1991: 1-2]. Such actions, if one were to borrow James Scott's 
expression, avoid any direct symbolic confrontation with 
authority but are not devoid of consciousness. The symbols, the 
norms, the ideological forms they create constitute the indis­
pensable background to their behaviour however imperfect or 
""partial their understanding of the situation might be"" [Scott 
1985: 38]. The world of witches, spirits and 'ojhas' (witch doctors 
and medicine men) was a very vibrant and reflective one; it 
resonated with, yet contested the impact of colonial rule in 
myriad ways.6 In the context of the significance and the fear in 
which witches and ojhas (also known as 'mati', 'sokha', 'jan 
guru') were held in the adivasi world, administrative regulations 
and a systematic tirade against witch-hunts and ojhaism in the 
years preceding 1857 were challenged and defied. Witch-hunts 
therefore represented a mode of resistance, which was 
apparently less direct, seemingly less confrontationist, and one 
with a greater community sanction. We shall further investigate 
this argument in the last section but a small discussion on adivasi 
constructions of witches here would help us comprehend 
things better. 218

with a greater community sanction. We shall further investigate 
this argument in the last section but a small discussion on adivasi 
constructions of witches here would help us comprehend 
things better. 218 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekfy 
'WITCH-HUNTING' 
Belief in 'dains'j'dans'j'churails' (witches) or 'bongas' (spirits) 
occupied a central place in adivasi cosmology and moral 
economy. ""There is no genuine Santal"", wrote Bodding, ""who does 
not believe in witches"" (1986: 38). Reak Katha records: ""Witch­
craft is the great trouble with us Santals. Because of witchcraft, 
people in the village become enemies, doors of relatives is shut, 
father and sons quarrel, brothers are separated, husband and 
wife are divorced and in the country people kill each other"" [in 
Bodding 1994: 160V While accepting that the practice was 
common to many countries, Valentine Ball noted that condi­
tions in the tribal heartland were particularly unique: ""It is a 
peculiarity here that the belief ( of witchcraft) was so thorough 
that even those who are accused of being witches or sorcerers 
do not deny the impeachment but accept the position readily 
with all its pains and penalties"" [Ball 1985: 115]. Considered a 
general social threat, such a belief was deeply soaked in tradition 
and ingrained in folklore. According to an old Oraon saying the 
world is as full of disembodied spirits ""as a tree is full of leaves"" 
[Roy 1984: 91 ]. The central idea behind the adivasi religious 
system therefore was to seek an alliance with the highest and the 
most ""helpful"" spiritual entities and through them control the 
""harmful"" ones [ibid: 93]. The evil powers had to be scared through 
exorcism or magic [Troisi 1979: 204]. The adivasis made a 
distinction between white magic (socially and psychologically 
beneficent) and black magic (maleficent or evil): The minister 
of white magic was known as ojha or diviner and medicine-man, 
while that of black magic, dan, witch or sorcerer {ibid). The ojha 
sought to expose and counteract the anti-social activities of 
witches and the evil influence of the impersonal spirits.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=252

while that of black magic, dan, witch or sorcerer {ibid). The ojha 
sought to expose and counteract the anti-social activities of 
witches and the evil influence of the impersonal spirits. The witches were feared as mysterious creatures imbued with 
phenomenal powers: "" ... [they] are supposed to have intercourse 
with the bong as, which gives them the power of killing people by 
eating their entrails and also of causing fevers, murrain in cattle 
and other kinds of evil"" [Man 1983: 152]. They can therefore kill 
either directly or by ""setting (up) the bongas"". The bongas in 
turn may bring destruction and death either by themselves or 
through agents [Raut 1979: 402]. The witches, adivasis held, not 
only ""ate"" persons and induced illness such as cholera, small­
pox, etc, but were also responsible for destroying crops, killing
Witch-hunts, Adivasis, and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur 219 
cattle and the like. The dains were, in fact, human embodiments 
of the ""evil-eye"" or ""evil-mouth"" [Roy 1985: 257] and could 
cause harm accordingly: if they cast ""evil-eyes"" on a person the 
victim suffered stomach complaints, headaches, fever, etc; if 
they uttered ""harmful"" lines by looking at somebody, the person 
was sure to suffer a fatal disease (Raut, ibid: 401-03]. Of particular interest here is the adivasi construction of 
disease and sickness and how they related to the urgent need for 
physical elimination of the witches. Wilkinson noted that the 
Kols believed in three causes that led to sickness - witchcraft, 
angry bongas or the spirit of someone who had died. While 
there was remedy for angry bongas and ancestor spirits who 
could be appeased by sacrifices - first of fowls, then goats, and 
if these two did not work then bullocks and buffaloes were 
offered - there was none for the witches who had to be removed 
(Singhbhum Old Records, p 271 ). Dalton extends the argument to 
include animals as well: ""all diseases in men or animals (are) 
attributed to one of two causes, the wrath of some evil spirit who 
has to be appeased, or to the spell of some witch or sorcerer who 
should be destroyed or driven out of (the) land"" (Dalton 1960: 
208].",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=253

208]. While these observations are largely true, these should not 
let us to believe that adivasis did not have any medicinal system. Bodding (1986), on the contrary writes about a fairly elaborate 
system of root medicines and herbs. However their world of 
""medicine"" was a fairly extended one including sacrifices, mantras 
(incantations), divinations, and amulets. The traditional roots 
and herbs were mostly supplemented or substituted by prescrip­
tions from the ojhas particularly in cases where the disease was 
uncommon, serious, or did not heal in a short time. Bodding 
says: "" .. .it is not strange that a suspicion is always present that witches 
may be at work when people fall ill and do not recover"" [Bodding 
1986: 38]. Man writes, ""no reasoning with them, nor ridicule can 
dissuade them of their belief in witches, and of the necessity of 
their being at once murdered"" [Man 1983: 29-30]. Elsewhere I have argued that witch-hunts were multiple 
reflections of social and gender tensions and how they inter­
sected with strains generated by the colonial rule to give new 
dimensions to ""ritualised violence"" [Sinha 2006]. The article 
however overlooks the fact that witchcraft also represented an 
arena for different, at times conflicting, notions of health and

medicinal systems: a conflict reaching a showdown in the years 
preceding the 1857. UNDERSTANDING THE PHENOMENA The preceding discussion provokes a lot of questions. What is so 
unusual about the witch-hunts around the mid-19th century or for 
that matter in 1857? Are there any comparable examples from 
adivasi world elsewhere in India? Why would these hunts be also 
labelled as having an anti-colonial element? How and why they 
should be seen as acts of resistance? After all the region had a long 
history of witch-hunts.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=254
255,"Are there any comparable examples from 
adivasi world elsewhere in India? Why would these hunts be also 
labelled as having an anti-colonial element? How and why they 
should be seen as acts of resistance? After all the region had a long 
history of witch-hunts. In 1792, John Shore had talked about the 
Santhal ways of ""trying witches"" [Archer 1979: 482]. Forbes in his 
Oriental Memoirs (1813) referred to some established witch-trials 
[Crooke 1969: 272]. According to the Campbell Notes, Buchanan 
learnt that 25 children died annually through the ""malevolence of 
witches"" at Bhagalpur [Crooke 1969: 284]. Wilkinson observed 
""murders related to witchcraft were a part of traditional practice in 
Singhbhum [and they] were not confined to the person supposed 
to be the witch but all near relations of the supposed witch killed so 
that none may remain to retaliate on parties who committed the 
murders"" [Roy Choudhury 1958: 88]. Dalton, the commissioner of 
Chhotanagpur during the revolt, mentions that accusations of 
witchcraft were made in many districts and persons who were thus 
denounced were subjected to much ""ill-usage"" if they could escape 
with their lives [Dalton 1872: 208]. The new entrants to the scene were a series of regulations by 
the colonial administration banning witch-hunts and ojhaism. Hardiman says that after their conquest of India, the British 
sought to outlaw persecution of witches; a practice seen by them 
as barbaric. Around the middle of 19th century (1840s-1850s), the 
ban on witch-hunts was enforced in Gujarat and Rajasthan 
[Hardiman 2006: 217-18; Skaria 1997: 135]. Wilkinson, the political 
agent of the Chhotanagpur agency in the 1830s, banned the 
practice of witchcraft and 'sokhaism' [Roy Choudhury 1958]. His famous directive (1837) necessitating comprehensive adminis­
trative interventions included specific instructions against 
murders related to witchcraft. Wilkinson wrote, ""I found a hope of 
destroying their belief in witchcraft by establishing a hospital, 
more particularly if the medical gentlemen who may have to attend
Witch-hunts, Adivasis, and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur 221 
the sick will take an interest in the human undertaking."" He stated: 
The conviction in the minds of the aboriginals that some persons have in 
their possession witchcraft causing illness, or epidemic had to be liqui­
dated. There should be an encouragement to bring the diseased to the 
hospitals and the doctors for a proper cure.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=255

liberally encouraged to explain that medicine only can cure the disease 
and if this message of cure through proper medicine be spread, belief in 
witchcraft will decrease {Singhbhum Old Records, p 271).8 
Bhadra says that by entrusting the 'mankis' with police powers, 
the colonial state gave them the task of punishing such new 
""crimes"" as witch-hunting [Bhadra 1985: 258-59]. Later, Dalton 
took firm measures to put down the practice of 'soka'. He 
declared it a crime for any person to practise a soka or any 
person to employ a soka. Cases of murder, which originated in 
witchcraft and in the power to be possessed by a soka, were to 
be treated as crime (Singhbhum Old Records, p 279}.9 
Skaria points out that most adivasis responded to the ban 
with hostility and resistance (p 138). In his study on the Bhils of 
western India, Hardiman asserts that colonial administrators 
failed to acknowledge the degree to which the notion of 
witchcraft was socially embedded and universally believed in as 
a matter of common sense [Hardiman 2006: 219]. Roy Choudhury 
argues that the zeal with which the early British administrators 
in Singhbhum threw themselves into reforming the ""jungle terry"" 
into a civilised tract was also partially responsible for the havoc 
that followed. He writes, ""It was mostly a case of mistaken 
wisdom and a result of not getting into the genius of the people 
and their mental framework before the policy was made ... To 
them (policymakers) the very ideas that went to make up the 
mental framework of the Hos were an anathema"" [Roy 
Choudhury 1959: 88]. The administrator mostly recruited from 
the military was in a state of perplexity. He cites a letter (No 57 
dated October 21) where the administrator was instructed that 
""it was not expedient to treat the enticing way of a married adult 
woman as a criminal offence while on the other hand was given 
repeated instructions to fight the deep belief in witchcraft and 
'Sokhaism'"" (ibid). While the administrators were confused the 
adivasis were agitated.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=256

adivasis were agitated. The witches eat us and when we catch them and worry them just a little, the 
magistrates again turn the matter round and resort to imprisonment; we
222 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week(y 
feel great distress; what can we possibly do, so that it might go well with 
us; we are utterly bewildered. Also when we explain it to magistrates 
they do not believe it; they say: Well then let her eat my finger, then 
only shall I believe she is a witch and then they jail you. The witches do 
not eat using a vessel and a knife, quite so; by sorcery they send people 
off to the other world straightaway (from the Reak Katha, p 160). The belief that witches were flourishing under the benevolent 
power of the British was increasingly gaining ground. Formerly the village headmen and his deputy were subduing them, and 
if they would not be peaceful, they would together with the village 
people, drive them away from the village after having disgraced them; 
but nowadays the magistrates have made them utterly audacious so that 
we men have become absolutely disheartened (ibid). The adivasis of the Dangs would say ""that since the Dakuns had 
received our [British] sympathy, they had become quite outra­
geous."" Others felt that dakans had increased since the British 
had established their rule [Skaria 1997: 139]. So intense and 
widespread was the belief in witchcraft that a fracture had 
already occurred in the colonial regulatory mechanism in the 
years preceding 1857. Ricketts in his report on the district of 
Singhbhum (1854) noted that the Mankis and the Mundas were 
reluctant to report cases related to witch-hunting because to the 
community it was no crime [Bhadra 1985: 259]. TouseHardiman's 
words, ""the practice was driven underground rather than sup­
pressed .. .local holders of power took action against witches 
because they were convinced that they had a duty to preserve 
their society from malign supernatural forces"" [Hardiman 2006: 
220].",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=257

led to attempts by ordinary Bhils, their chiefs, and even the local 
Rajput power-holders, to conceal killings from the British [Skaria 
1997: 138]. The climax came during the political disturbances surround­
ing 1856-57 when the hold of the British administration was 
temporarily loosened. In his account of the hul (the Santhal 
rebellion) Chotrae Deshmanjhi describes how a number of girls 
accused of witchcraft were shown ""the pod and pea"" and slained 
[Archer 1984: 482-83; Arther 1979: 4]. Ball similarly points out, 
""during the disturbed times of the mutiny in 1857-58, when law 
was suspended in these regions, the Kols of Singhbhum and 
other parts of the province availed themselves of their freedom
Witch-hunts, Adivasis, and the Uprising in Chhotanagpur 223 
to make a clean sweep of the witches and sorcerers who had 
accumulated in their midst, under the benign influence of 
British authority"" [Ball 1985: 116]. Though most killings went 
unreported one could even see the turnaround in the cases 
registered with the police. Under the first class of offence against the person there is a remarkable 
increase in the number of murders. The average of the previous five 
years was seven cases in which eighteen persons were implicated. The 
returns of 1859 exhibit fifty-nine cases of murder, in which 218 persons 
were implicated. It appears, however that 50 of these cases occurred 
during the disturbances of 1857 and 1858, the people availing them­
selves of the temporary withdrawal of our authority to indulge in their 
superstitious desire of exterminating witchcraft. Further, the terrible 
destruction of human life, as Lieutenant Birch remarks, which was 
caused by this superstition is difficult to contemplate (Singhbhum Old 
Records, p 134). 10 
Effectively combining both gender and anti-colonial tensions, 
witch-hunts were systematically incorporated into the mobilisation 
strategies of the anti-colonial adivasi movements in 
Chhotanagpur.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=258

brotherhood's right to the forest they had settled in, women were 
denounced as witches and killed. K Suresh Singh refers to an 
Ulgulan song in which the principal enemies of the tribes 
witches, Europeans, and other castes (dikus) are placed in the 
same category. Oh kill the witch, such the poison, 
0 kill, kill 
0 Father, kill the Europeans, the other castes 
0 kill, kill [Singh 2002: 101]. NOTES

The Mutiny Novel 
Creating the Domestic Body of the Empire 
Aishwarya Lakshmi 
IN 1897, when Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine observed, ""Of 
all the great events of this century as they are reflected in fiction, 
the Indian Mutiny has taken the firmest hold on the popular 
imagination"" [Anon: 218], it was empire as a domestic space that 
was being consumed. This paper argues that though the adven­
ture novel has come to stand metonymically for the ""novel of the 
empire"", from mid-century onwards, Victorians increasingly 
imagined India as a domestic space standing in a contrastive yet 
politically and morally necessary relation to the metropolitan 
nation. This figuration ultimately created the moral economy of 
colonialism, and continued to undergir<l even early 20th cen­
tury adventure novels like Kim. The key incident in this shift was 
the Mutiny of 1857, which marked a shift in governance from the 
rule of the Mughal emperor, with East India Company as 
protectors, to the Crown. Mutiny novels code this shift as 
a movement away from India as a space of adventure and 
begin to create the empire as a domestic space.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=262

a movement away from India as a space of adventure and 
begin to create the empire as a domestic space. By an examina­
tion of two Mutiny novels, Meadows Taylor's Seeta (1872) and 
Flora A Steel's On the Face of the Waters (1896), I show that this 
domestic body of the empire was gendered and deterministic. I argue that this figuration reified the early 19th century 
depictions of India as a ""feminine land"", and brought it in a 
morally necessary and subservient relation to Britain by yoking 
the previous masculine west and feminine east division within 
the confines of an unequal marriage. Literary critics, in discussing the Mutiny novel, have focused 
on its ""gothic"" aspect: the fascination with rape and horror, the 
blatant racism, and the figuration of the English and Indian

women within it as symbols of chastity and licentiousness 
respectively, both in need of rescue. 1 When the gendered and 
domestic body of the post-1858 space has been discussed, it has 
been in terms of the figure of the Indian woman in these novels 
who metonymically stands for ""India"" in need of moral and 
civilisational rescue (the converse is the figure of the English 
woman who stands in for the empire in need of the organisation 
of military chivalry) and in terms of the ""separation of spheres"" 
of the racial divide within this body. I show that it is the 
figuration of the land that ultimately creates the gendered, 
deterministic body of the empire, with India as the passive 
feminine and the British as the active masculine partner, and 
that it is this intimate and ""necessary"" relation that undergirds 
the separation of spheres policy practised in colonial relations 
with India post-1858. This paper revises Antoinette Burton's claim arising from her 
work on British feminists in England that mid-century onwards,

work on British feminists in England that mid-century onwards, 
Victorians were increasingly imagining England and India 
""concentrically"" rather than constrastively [Burton 1994: 35]. Burton shows that British feminists by making the ""uplift"" of 
Indian women their special province, a task necessary for the 
moral good of the empire, re-imagined the national public 
space as a national-imperial one. This allowed them to argue for 
an extension of this space to include women in an enhanced 
public (yet still within the traditional female) role. Thus Burton 
argues, Victorians widened the circumference of the national 
space and drew India within it. While I agree with Burton that 
India was being imagined as an extension of the national space, 
reconceived as a national-imperial one, I show that this space 
was not a uniform space circumscribed from a fixed centre 
(metropole), as Burton's geometric analogy suggests. Instead, 
this space was differentiated, comprising of an active, masculine 
metropolitan and a passive, feminine, colonial space, a differ­
ence that created a ""centre"" and lent dynamism to it. Thus, just as the passive figure of the Indian woman lent a 
dynamism to the feminist discourse, the figuration of the 
feminised Indian land 1860 onwards lent mobility to the colo­
nial discourse. This feminised land, however, marks a shift from 
the late 18th and early 19th centuries picturesque and romantic 
figurations of it, where the ""feminine east"", stood in varying

nostalgic landscape. Images of fading, classical grandeur subli­
mated by temporalising present confrontations but worked as 
an oppositional ""Other"" to a dynamic, expanding Britain, albeit 
in limited ways. In romantic figuration, best expressed in Lady 
Morgan's 1811 novel, The Missionary, the feminine east, both in 
the Indian priestess, Luxima, and the exotic locale of Kashmir, 
serves as a counterpoint (even if a deceptive one) to the 
masculine west (here the Portuguese missionary, Hilarion) with 
the power to subvert it by seduction. 2 The Mutiny novel, by 
yoking this opposition (romantic of masculine Britain to feminised 
India) and quasi-opposition (between the picturesque fading 
grandeur and vigour of British expansion) into a domestic 
framework, not only bound east to west in an ideologically 
necessary relation but also made one party subservient and 
passive. Furthermore, any subversive potential of this feminised 
land was erased by depicting its picturesque and exotic beauty 
not as a property of the land but of the British eye. The 
feminised post-Mutiny India, unlike the earlier romantic or 
picturesque feminine, is closed in on itself and inert. This feminised, domestic land undergirds later adventure 
novels set in India. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 
India was recuperated as a space of adventure in fiction: in 
novels like Kim, and in popular juvenile fiction like that of 
G A Henty (Boyd 2000: 66-68). Literary history has tended to 
see the adventuring space of India sketched in these novels as 
continuous with the late 18th and early 19th centuries adventure 
narratives of merchants and mercenary soldiers. I show that the 
two spaces are in fact radically different. The adventuring space 
traversed by boy-heroes bears little resemblance to the foreign 
terrain which the early 19th century adventurer-heroes like 
Henry Lawrence, James Skinner, and to some extent, even 
Meadows Taylor negotiated. Instead, these adventures take 
place in a bound, surveilled domestic space of India, a creation 
of the Mutiny novel.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=265

to plot the empire as a space of adventure; from the late 18th to

of the late 19th century adventure novel within the post-Mutiny 
domestic ideology and figuration of the empire. CREATING GENDERED AND DOMESTICATED SPACE On May 10, 1857, soldiers of the Bengal Army in Mirath, 
India, revolted and killed their British commanding officers. The soldiers then marched to Delhi and entreated the by now 
titular Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, to head the revolt 
against the British. This appeal was followed by revolts by 
several other native regiments in north India, who congregated 
in Delhi and in other Indian courts, like that of the court of the 
(recently deposed) Nawab of Awadh in Lucknow. The British, 
who had been completely taken by surprise, recuperated 
quickly, and by late September 1857, the city of Delhi was 
retaken after a prolonged siege. The fall of Delhi was a decisive 
blow to the mutineers but fighting continued well into 1859 as 
the struggle was continued by peasants under local landlords 
and rebel leaders. In March 1858, the Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, 
was put on trial, found guilty of ""treasonable design of over­
throwing and destroying the British government in India"", and 
exiled to Burma (Noorani: 19). In November 1858, Queen 
Victoria's proclamation enacted the transfer of power from the 
Mughal emperor (with the East India Company as protectors) 
to the Crown and granted pardon to all those who surrendered 
who were not guilty of murdering an Englishman or woman. The document used the language of benevolent maternalism 
with Victoria as a sort of mother figure, willing to grant ""mercy"" 
and ""take back"" her subject-sons.3Begum Hazrat Mahal (the 
queen who kept up resistance to the British in Lucknow) 
rebutted the proclamation and rejected the offer of surrender, 
pointing out that this ""maternalism"" was misleading at best and 
disingenuous at worst.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=266

trial ( or any trial at all, in many cases) for those who surrendered 
but the offer dispossessed all those who rebelled. Moreover, 
entrance into the domestic body of the British empire was 
founded on the punishment of ""a whole army and people""4for 
a rebellion against a government that did not exist prior to it. The Mutiny Novel: Creating the Domestic Body of the Empire 233 
Acting on both the past and present, the proclamation and 
trial heralded the domestic body of the empire. The ""our 
government"" of the trial and proclamation appeared to pre­
rather than post-date the Mutiny, retroactively creating the 
""legal conditions"" for the king to be put on trial for ""treason."" Furthermore, by not simply dispossessing the Mughal ruler but 
making him appear in court on charges of sedition, the very 
symbols of the past were put on trial to legitimate the present 
and change the shift of ruling powers: from an act of usurpation 
to a lawful procedure. Thus, while British counter-insurgency 
operations in which rebels were blown from guns and hung on 
trees, while villagers were burnt followed the classic Foucauldian 
paradigm of leaving traces of its brutality in ""spectacles"" to 
make British power visible, in discourses of the law, politics, and 
fiction another kind of memory formation was enacted: to erase 
the traces of violence and create the past as illegitimate. Since the 
violence of the ""counter-insurgency"" operations was directed 
against the sovereign body of the Mughal ruler, it could not 
function as the legitimate in discourse, unless the old law was itself 
put on trial and dis-credited. 5",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=267

to convert violence into the form of the Law that could perform 
important retroactive ideological work on the past and the imme­
diate present. Ultimately, what this discourse stands testimony to, 
therefore, is a usurpation and ""appropriation of a vocabulary 
turned against those who once used it"".0 This paper focuses on one element of that discourse, Mutiny 
fiction, and examines two Mutiny novels, Seeta and On the Face 
of the Waters, to outline the ideological work these novels did for 
the empire. I show that the novels created a gendered, domestic 
space of India that in a move similar to the proclamation, erased 
the revolutionary potential of the Mutiny and created the 
empire's normativity. This was achieved in two ways: by 
structuring the novels as a movement from adventurous, disor­
dered space to a domestic ordered one, and using the Mutiny 
to make the historical law (the historical need of the Indians for 
the British) visible. The latter is achieved by racialising aesthet­
ics and the land, such that both become evidentiary and reveal 
this law. Like the proclamation, therefore, the novels transform 
the Mutiny, from a contested time-space to a transparent event 
that reveals India's ""need"" for Britain. 234

Civil Service (ICS) men, mixed with Indians and adopted some 
modes of their life. Ideologically as well, he was closer to the 
utilitarian reforming zeal of the 1830s. Seeta forms the third part 
of a trilogy, comprised also of Tara and Ralph Darnell, the 
former being set in 1657 and depicting the rise of the Marathas 
(which in part led to the weakening of the Mughals in the 17th 
century), and the latter in 17 57, the year of the battle of Plassey. Seeta, set in 1857, and recounting a tale of the Mutiny, completes 
and ""fulfil"" the story of British ascendancy in India. Seeta, first published in 1872, though a post-Mutiny novel is 
written from a perspective that was largely unfamiliar to, even 
condemned in the post-Mutiny era. Most markedly, the novel 
depicts an inter-racial marriage, something that though 
accepted in the early 19th century was virtually anathema post­ Mutiny.7 The marriage is central to the plot, which is as follows: 
Cyril Brandon, the young magistrate of Norpoor, falls in love 
with Seeta when she appears in court to identify the assailant, 
Azrael Pande, her husband's murderer. Defying convention, 
Cyril and Seeta get married. Soon after marriage, Cyril realises 
that though their marriage is happy and Seeta an accomplished 
woman (in Sanksrit scriptures), she will never be the kind of 
companion that an Englishwoman could be. He finds himself 
attracted to Grace Mostyn, his friend's sister-in-law. Seeta also 
faces trouble in the form of caste excommunication, exclusion 
from Cyril's English life and friends, the pressure to become 
Christian, and finally the realisation that her marriage will not 
be recognised as legitimate under English law. Any children 
born of the union will be debarred from the right of inheritance 
(on Cyril's side). The domestic troubles coincide with the 
coming of the Mutiny, and one day when the rebels, led by 
Azrael Pande, attack the house, Seeta is shot trying to save Cyril.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=269

She dieb, Cyril and Grace return to England, where they get 
married and eventually inherit Cyril's ancestral property. The novel uses the picturesque to create India as a domestic 
space and mark the difference between British and Indians, in 
order to delegitimise the latter's claim to the land. The pictur­
esque is pitted against the Indian's ""sacred"" consumption and 
activation of the land. The picturesque and the sacred land­
scape aesthetics were in fact dominant modes of depicting the 
land by the British and Indians respectively in the early 19th 
century. The picturesque, where one viewed the land ""as in a 
picture"", derived pleasure from this act, and recorded the view 
in journals or sketches, was a prominent mode of consuming 
India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by the British. The 
sacred landscape aesthetic, practised by Indians in the same 
period, is a more inclusive term, comprising of several land­
scape styles (such as the Mughal, the courtly) but all were 
characterised by non-realistic and hieratic depictions of the 
land. In the novel, the picturesque retains some of its specificity 
as a landscape aesthetic but the sacred landscape aesthetic 
transforms into the general term ""sacred"" denoting various 
kinds of engagement with and on behalf of the land - from 
religious worship to rebellion (guided by religious motivation). The novel, however, historicises and racialises both aesthetics. Thus instead of being modes of imaging, negotiating, and 
mapping oneself on to the land, they become markers of ""states 
of civilisation"": the picturesque of the modern and civil and the 
sacred of the static and non-modern. The final reification takes 
place towards the end of the novel in a ""trial scene"", where the 
picturesque and sacred are pitted against each other and the 
sacred loses. Like the trial of the emperor, however, this is 
also a staged event in which one party has lost even before 
entering the court. The very opening paragraphs of the novel set up the opposition 
between the picturesque and the sacred.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=270

picturesque description that moves into a description of how the 
land is the repository of layers of civilisation and ancient memory: It was nearly midnight. A slight passing shower had just fallen, and the 
moon, nearly at its full, shone out with brilliant luster over a scene at 
once strikingly beautiful and impressive. At the head of one of the long 
ravines which descend westwards from the plateau of central India,
236 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
was a deep, lonely glen, the upper end of which was closed by one of 
those abrupt precipices of basalt, which everywhere a small stream, 
swelled somewhat beyond its wont by showers of the rainy season, now 
poured a considerable body of water with a dull continuous roar. .. At 
the foot of the fall, and bordering part of the pool, was however an open 
space, now covered with soft green sward, the only level spot in the 
glen for some miles of its course, where, on one occasion in each year, 
the people of the country round held a kind of fair, bathed in the waters 
of the pool, and worshipped the local deities to whom it was held 
sacred. At other times, indeed, the place had an evil reputation, and 
was carefully avoided. At the back of this level spot, grew a vast peepul tree of enormous size 
and remarkably picturesque though peculiar character. ( 1-2) 
The above leads into a description of a banyan tree, the site of Hindu 
worship, and the sacred character of the tree reached far beyond that, 
to a period when it was probably adored, together with the image of 
the rudely carved twisted snakes which lay at its foot, by the ancient 
tree and snake worshipping tribes of the country. By the side of the

lamp black. This had existed from rude times, even beyond those of the

excavated from the trap-rock a small Vihara or monastery .. . It con­
sisted of a square hall, at the end of which, in an apse or recess, was a 
large statue of Boodh in a sitting posture, ... and it seemed as if the mild, 
placid features ever looked out benignly into the beautiful glen, and 
over the sparkling waters of the stream. (2) 
The second passage works with a different perspective from 
the first, as it descends from a place of transcendent viewing to

Buddha gazes in the same manner as the narrator in the opening 
paragraph, and this alignment gives internal sanction to the 
narrator's own gaze. Buddha, here, works as W J T Mitchell's 
""threshold"" figure, who ""sits in"" for the narrator (artist), and 
allows us entry into the native space. As Mitchell has argued, the 
particular task of the threshold figure is to sanction the gaze of 
the narrator (artist), by revealing that the native deity (figure) 
""sees"" in the same manner as the narrator (artist).8 Buddha sanctions the gaze of the narrator, which emerges as 
the ideal and politically right consumption of the land. Only 
viewing in the manner of the narrator (and the proxy figure of 
the Buddha) gives access to wholly unproblematic, ""neutral,"" 
beautiful scenes. Apart from the ""view"" of the waterfall (by 
Buddha) and of the ravine (by the narrator), all other spaces and 
objects are double-edged: the banyan tree throws shadows ""in 
weird, ghastly forms"", the stones, if neglected, can cause ""sore 
penalties of sickness"", and the glen itself transforms into an ""evil 
space"" at times. The other consumption of the land, that the 
villagers engage in with the local deities, leads to a double­
edged activation of the land. Yet another activation by the rebels is also suspect, and is 
given in our first introduction to them: about 20 men ""whose 
savage appearance betokened a hard, lawless life"" are congre­
gated around a fire in the cave, ""and as the flames leaped high,

around, and the great image behind with it its soft, placid

figure of Buddha sanctioned the narrator's gaze previously, now 
the figure condemns these men. The men are bandits (who will 
eventually become rebels), and their image, which is at odds 
with the calm one of Buddha, makes them internally dissonant 
with the landscape. The bandit rebels are the reverse of the 
threshold figure. Not only do they not gaze like the narrator but 
they are at odds with and their presence unsanctioned by the

entrance into the social body - the village of Shah Gunje, in 
which the novel is set 
is also conceived as an infection and a 
threat, which is neutralised only in their deaths at the hands of 
Cyril and Mostyn. The community is now ""rehabilitated"" and is 
like a fair. Next morning the town was like a fair. The people from villages around 
brought garlands of flowers, and laid them at Br Brandon and Temple's

market, is a ""fair"", and there is rejoicing ""as had never been 
remembered before"" (Seeta: p 398). This ""restitution"" of the 
communal space does to memory what the counter-insurgency 
operations did to the land, which is to wipe out the ""clinging to 
the memories of old rulers and old systems of government"" 
(Seeta: p 425). The novel obfuscates memory by showing the 
rebellion to be not part of the communal body at all. The rebels 
are an infection, and the rebellion the ""evil year"" that had to run 
its course, rather than a year of possibility to which were tied the 
hopes and aspirations of many people. What was remarkable 
about the Mutiny was precisely its communal nature: how, 
despite lacking a common cause and unitary organisation, it was 
taken up by diverse groups of people and its hopes adopted by 
even the spectators. As Kant points out in his discussion of the 
French Revolution, the historical potential of a revolutionary 
event lies not with the actors but with the spectators' reaction to 
the event. 9Taylor, in denying that the Mutiny had a social 
spectatorial aspect

significant way - by making it merely an act of personal, 
misguided vengeance, cuts away at the historical potential of the 
event for Indians. The Mutiny Novel: Creating the Domestic Body of the Empire 239

undesirable but also the ""good"" subjects who are unable to 
spectate: Seeta, the exemplary subject, accomplished and 
civilised in her own right, is unable to spectate as well, and 
finally marks the ""fact"" that it is not the Indians but the British 
who have a claim over the land. The connection between visual 
purchase of and actual proprietary claim over the land is made 
in an incident that takes place in a ""trial scene"" towards the end 
of the novel: Seeta, Cyril, and Grace all find themselves in a 
temple on a hill, on the side of which a river runs. Seeta is 
engaged in an act of worship, and Cyril and Grace admire the 
prospect by picturesque gazing and sketching. It is only the 
latter two who are able to ""properly appreciate"" the land: Seeta, 
herself, is engaged in quite another act, and when she does cease 
worshipping, she becomes the subject of Grace's sketch that 
Cyril completes. 10 
The scene dimly echoes one in Northanger Abbey, where 
Henry Tilney and Catherine Morland are on Beechen Cliff 
overlooking the city of Bath, and Henry gives Catherine a 
lecture on picturesque viewing [Austen 1948: 86-88]. Though 
Austen is partly satirising the picturesque craze in the above, the 
scene also establishes the kind of companionship their marriage 
will be: one between not quite intellectual equals, but where one 
only too willing and able to learn - can be ""tutored"" into the 
proper companion. In the scene on the hill in Seeta, the 
picturesque also marks the legitimate pair and the nature of 
heterosexual companionship. It ""unites"" Cyril and Grace, as 
they share in the pleasure of spectation, and marks that they are 
the legitimate pair. It shuts Seeta out by pointing out that she is 
not capable of being tutored into picturesque gazing (the entire 
novel chronicles the attempts and failure of Cyril to make her 
into a Victorian wife).",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=276

a greater purchase on the land than Seeta. She is not a 
""spectator"" herself, and according to Taylor's logic, lacks the 
adequate modern understanding equated here with visual 
consumption of the land that is the pre-requisite of being a 
citizen. In a re-adjustment of the alignment of the actual 
ownership of property and proprietary viewing of the landscape 
in England in the early 19th century that Helsinger has pointed 
out [Helsinger 1994: 103-25], here, although Seeta is the heir to 
a substantial amount of property, her lack of proprietary view­
ing (that the idea of landscape encourages) signals an inability 
to participate in the kind of citizenry of the empire open to the 
English pair. Her own worship and person can be the subject of 
the picturesque gaze and sketch but like the idols in the opening 
paragraph, is meant to merely inhabit not possess and own 
the landscape. Taylor uses the picturesque to create the desirable object 
of the land, to prove the undesirability or inertness of the 
Indians' consumption and activation of it, and thus genderises 
as well seals the social body from within, with respect to its 
capacity for mobility on its own. It is finally in the scene on the

equating the picturesque with modern sensibility and the right 
to citizenship, Taylor calls on the liberal-reformist thought of 
J S Mill, which rests political morality on the institutions of 
modernity and makes full citizenship contingent on the posses­
sion of a modern sensibility, but renders static the pedagogic 
dynamism of this ideology (where at the end of the road, India 
would be tutored into civility and modernity) by making the 
inability to spectate an intrinsic attribute of Indians. In the next novel, the picturesque is used sparingly and is 
coded differently from Seeta. Instead of allowing for the attach­
ment of affect to land created as desirable object, the pictur­
esque appears (when applied to Indian land and buildings) as 
the sign of the immoral and the intellectually deficient. Steel

On the Face of the Waters, first published in 1896, was written 
by Flora Anna Steel (1847-1929). Steel, like Taylor, spend a 
great part of her life (22 years) in India, and felt a strong 
connection with the country. Steel was a Scot by birth and came 
to India in 1867, as the wife of a British officer, Henry Steel, in 
the ICS, and remained there till 1887. She came back in 1894 
to conduct the research for the novel, when she went through 
government archives, and like her heroine, Kate Erlton, lived 
on the roof of a house, to get a feel of what it was like [Steel 1930: 
15]. Like Taylor, Steel was also a firm imperialist, and indeed, 
evinces a racism that is absent in Taylor. Steel wrote several 
novels and short stories set in India, and also published collec­
tions of Indian folk-tales. 11 She is best known, however, for her 
Mutiny novel, and for a handbook for Anglo-Indian housewives 
The Complete Indian Housekeeper and Cook (1888), that became 
the ""Bible of young memsahibs"" in India in the 19th and early 
20th century [Sen: 33]. On the Face of the Waters received critical acclaim on its first 
publication in the heyday of British imperialism in India: it was 
very popular and ran into several editions. Some likened 
Steel to Kipling, and welcomed the novel as the first serious 
novel or.i the Mutiny [Patwardhan: 41]. The novel revolves 
around the story of Kate Erlton, caught in an unhappy marriage 
with Major Erlton, who is having an affair with a Mrs Alice 
Gissing. The hero, Jim Douglas (alias James Greyman) enters 
Kate's life when she wishes to bribe him into smoothing over an 
indiscretion of her husband. Their lives become intertwined 
when the Mutiny occurs, and Kate finds herself fleeing with 
Douglas. They travel in disguise for a while, live concealed in 
Delhi, and finally are saved when the British conquer the city in

side of the story, in the sub-plot of the platonic love affair 
between the widowed princess Farkhoonda Zamani, living in a 
street, Mufti's alley, in Delhi, and Prince Abool-Bukr, the king's 
(Bahadur Shah Zafar's) eldest son. The two stories briefly 
intersect when Kate is given shelter by Farkhoonda but end very 
differently. Kate and Jim are united at the end of the novel 
(Major Erlton having died in battle), whereas Abool-Bukr, on 
surrender, is treacherously killed by Major Hodson (the last two 
characters are historically real and so is the incident), and 
Farkhoonda continues in Delhi in relative poverty, subsisting on 
the income she derives from teaching at a girl's school. We are 
also given a sketch of the life at the palace of Bahadur Shah and 
his wife, Zeenat Mahal (again, both real historical characters), 
which was the seat of rebellion till the city fell, and the king and 
his wives (the princes were massacred) were exiled to Burma. Steel uses the picturesque sparingly to describe the Mughal 
palaces and buildings in Delhi but codes this beauty in a 
Ruskinian manner, indicating that it displays the pleasure of 
refinement for its own sake, divorced from nature, ""and thus 
speak[ing] to the destruction both of intellectual power and 
moral principle"" in its Indian creators [Ruskin: I OJ. The Ruskinian 
formulation of artistic Indian objects is complemented by the 
understanding of everyday Indian landscape and created ob­

form and matter, terms that fall on the moral/immoral divide. Steel depicts quotidian Indian spaces as oppressive and not 
pleasing to the western eye, an oppressiveness that derives from 
a sense of twin lacks in it: of morality and of form. Both

of waves curve upon a wind-swept northern sea. Far and near, wide as the 
eye could reach, there was nothing to be seen save this - a waving sea of 
green wheat crested by yellow mustard. But in the centre, whence the eye 
looked, stood a human ant-hill; for the congeries of mud alleys, mud walls,

mud roofs, forming the village, looked from a little distance·nothing else. Viewed broadly, too, it was simply earth made plastic by the Form-bringer, 
water, hardened again by Sun-fire; the triple elements combined into a 
shell for labouring life . 
... It is a scene which to most civilised eyes is oppressive in its self­
centred isolation, its air of remoteness. The isolation of a community 
self-supporting, self-sufficing, the remoteness of a place which cares not 
if, indeed, there be a world beyond its boundaries {pp 118--19). The ""form-bringer"" in this scene is not the human beings but 
water: it is what renders this scene dynamic and creates shapes. It is no wonder that this scene is ""oppressive"" to the western eye, 
for apart from the natural element of water, there seems no 
higher human activating principle that is capable of giving form 
and dynamism to this inert matter of the land. Indeed, the

reinforcing this eye and its gaze, for it points out that the ""counter­

villagers do not care to and do not look out to the world. The Mutiny renders dynamic this still, oppressive picture, 
and works as a potential ""form-bringer"". When Douglas hears 
the report of a spy that Moulvie, a rebel, is wanted for he is to 
give the ""word"" that is to start the rebellion, 
Jim Douglas felt an odd thrill. He had never thought of that before. Some one, of course, must always give the word, the speech 
which brought more than speech. What would it be? Something soul­
stirring, no doubt; for Humanity had a theory that an angel must 
trouble the waters and so give it a righteous cause for stepping in to heal 
the evil {p 162). The rebellion, pictured here not simply as an act of blind or 
bestial vengeance but aligned with the ""word"", points to not 
only a rational organisation behind the event but to an active 
human agency guided by a divinity or prophecy that could 
render the social body and history dynamic. The latter emerges 
in the passage's biblical allusions: to Genesis, where the word and

creates form out of the void earth, and to kings, where the

cally: as a fulfilment of the centenary prophecy that British rule 
would end a hundred years from the Battle of Plassey, 17 57 [Kaye 
and Malleson 1891: 356-57]. Moulvie's giving of the ""word"", 
therefore, could follow the above formulations, as a human act 
that is ultimately guided by a divine power. It could also work 
within a secular framework, where the ""word"" has the possibility 
of ""making history"" in the western historiographic sense, of a 
willed act that sets a certain trajectory in motion. The ""word"" 
would then open up history and reality by working as the 
""latent, unuttered future word"", as a signal, pointing to a yet 
unimagined future, as set forth in the following formulation by 
Dostoevsky: ""reality in its entirety is not to be exhausted by what 
is immediately at hand, for an overwhelming part of this reality 
is contained in the form of a still latent, unuttered future Word"" 
[Morris 1994: 100]. The rebel's word, however, is none of these. It is not the 
Indian spy but Jim who recognises the place of the word in 
making history and feels the ""thrill"" at this understanding. The 
Indian use of the word is purely instrumental and not a little 
base: to use ""soul-stirring"" rhetoric to arouse immediate passion 
for the cause. While the rebels might well work within and be 
guided by a prophetic framework, the letter of the prophecy is 
false and their use of it base. Finally, they are unable to take a 
spectatorial stance towards the prophecy that would allow 
them, like Jim, to understand its place in making history.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=283

merely follows the letter of the word; hence is an act of repetition 
rather than an act that opens up the present and future. Instead, 
it is the ripple caused by the gain-bringing angel, recalled from 
kings that works as the true ""word"" in the passage. The move­
ment of the ripple sets a certain historical action in motion (the 
rebellion), necessitating the intervention of the British, as 
agents of god and healers. This ""word,"" however, though it 
seems to be opening up present reality, actually ""exhausts"" it, 
for it is able to predict and mark the course of the future. The 
openness of the present, therefore, that is real in Dostoevsky, 
both in the actual socius and in the novel that portrays the
The Mutiny Novel: Creating the Domestic Body of the Empire 245 
""reality"" of the socius, becomes part of a causal sequence in 
On the Face of the Waters. The passage does, however, mimic the 
dynamism of the ""latent Word"", creating an internal, mystical 
dynamism of colonialism. Instead of opening up the oppressive scene of the ant-hill, the 
Mutiny reinforces its inertness by showing that the ""word"" of the 
Indian cannot be aligned with the spirit that activates history. Hisjher action is incapable of working as the ""form-bringer"". If 
the mutiny is aligned with the ""spirit"", it is that of the angel, of 
Steel's recalled Kings or the God of Genesis who temporarily 
causes a disturbance on the waters so it can purify it and rid the

oppressiveness in another direction: the land is no longer

falling figure (of a drunk sepoy), waited, fluttering over the topmost 
branches for it to pass, or paused among them to fill up the time with 
a last twittering song of good-night to the day; for the sun still lingered 
in the heat-haze on the horizon as if loath to take its glow from that 
corona of red dust above the northern wall of Delhi; mute sign of the 
only protest made, as yet, by the Master against the mutiny. And now He had left the city to its own devices. The rebels were free 
to do as they liked (p 235). The land finally meets the desire and narcissism of the 
civilised eye and works as a sign signalling its own need of this 
eye. The very sun is unwilling to take its glow from the red dust 
created by the hoofs of the rebel horses in Delhi, in protest of 
the British ""master's""departure from the city. The birds, the sun, 
all go about their tasks unwillingly and wait the return of ""the 
master's"" steps, and when the British re-conquer it, the city is 
described as ""once more echoing to the master's steps, and the 
city-folk, as they looked eagerly from the walls, had the first 
notice of defeat in the smoke and flames of the sepoy lines"" 
(280..81). There were, of course, no eager spectators when the 
British entered the city; they had to, in fact, win the city street

lation here, for the Indians are shown as welcoming not only a

and Indians finally creates a master/slave dialectic between 
British and Indians. 12This relationship works with a body 
metaphor, with the British as ""spirit"" and Indians as the ""body"", 
and not only makes the relation between the two a spiritually 
necessary one but also converts what is a despotic relation 
depending on stasis for its continuation, into a mystical and 
dynamic relation. It also makes Indians emerge as non-specta­
tors at a higher (or lower) level than in Seeta: Indians are 
intrinsically unable to be activating agents of history - their 
agency is only of the natural, labouring kind (and never goes 
beyond this even in the rebellion), and will never be able to take 
the spectatorial stance that the ""spirit"" can towards history, 
which is the prerequisite for ""making history"" in this schema. CHANGING FIGURATIONS OF INDIA Both novels create a gendered domestic body of the empire. It is the elision of the ""gaze"" of the land, however, (apart from 
a narcissistic one) that marks a major shift from early 19th 
century romantic and picturesque figurations of India and 
creates land as not only feminised, as in the past but determined 
and bound to its master. This imagination of the empire was 
popular, as the sheer number of Mutiny novels (around 40) 
published in the latter half of the 19th century indicates, and 
heralded the major Anglo-Indian novel form, the ""station 
romance"", that came into its own and dominated the second half

of 
obliteration of the revolutionary historical potential of the 
Mutiny, and of a ""new"" post-1858 space in which no traces of the 
past would linger.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=286

from the times, which also set out, ambitiously and fantastically, 
to create a blank slate of India. A brief example will suffice. In June 1858, Lord Canning, the 
last governor-general of the East India Company and the first
The Mutiny Novel: Creating the Domestic Body of the Empire 
247 
viceroy of the crown, issued a proclamation to confiscate all 
proprietary rights in the land of Awadh, so that that once the 
land had been cleared of all previous titles, it could more easily 
be awarded to the new proprietors as a ""free and incontestable 
grant from the paramount power"" [Metcalf 1964: 147]. In reality, 
Canning's fantasy of obliterating past titles could not be acted 
out. James Outram, commissioner of Awadh, was aware that 
such a move would prolong the rebellion and realising that the 
country could not be restored to peace without the help of the 
old taluqdars (landlords), sent out the proclamation with a cover 
letter granting a one-on-one settlement of lands with the landlords, 
thus limiting the force of Canning's proclamation. Ultimately 
Canning himself came around and was instrumental in creating 
a powerful body of taluqdars, with increased rights in the land 
in Awadh, serving as a bulwark for the empire against the 
unrestful agrarian, peasant population [Metcalf 1964: 150-56]. Memory transformation and even erasure did take place but 
not in the initial 'tabula rasa' fantasy of Canning or of the Mutiny 
novel, which effectively creates a blank slate of Indian memory. The reinstatement of the taluqdars took place by disregarding 
all customary rights of the peasants in the land, which had 
hitherto given them negotiating power with the landlords. The 
taluqdars, therefore, continued, not as mere revenue collectors 
of the Mughal emperor or the Awadh nobility but as magistrate 
and landlord all rolled into one [Metcalf 1964: 150-54].",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=287

system, only resembled it in name, and in fact concealed 
massive ground-level changes. What was lost and erased did not 
manage to make its way into narrative and legal discourse, 
except for occasional concerns expressed by British and Indian 
champions of peasant rights. British policy, post-1858, generally 
followed the trend of Canning's revised decision and was 
consistently characterised by ""non-interference"" and a preser­
vation of ""tradition."" This ""tradition,"" however, was a creation 
of colonialism. Its ""preservation"" only led to a hardening of 
previously fluid institutions. Similarly, the Mutiny novel obscured memory of the 
picturesque and sacred aesthetics by a continued usage but in 
changed and historicised forms. The historicised picturesque 
and sacred aesthetics not only pre- rather than post-date the

to emerge from the ""past"", obscuring their early 19th century 
usages but also become ""evidentiary"": of the historical necessity 
and inevitability of British victory and Indian defeat during the 
Mutiny. Historicism's marking of these aesthetics as historical 
winners and losers gained ground in the latter part of the 19th 
century and continues to inform post-colonial India. In the 
1880s, when proto-national figurations oflndia begin to emerge, 
it is the picturesque which is used to create a mythological,

the Mutiny, the sacred is depicted as the sign of a limited 
imagination, incapable of taking a spectatorial, ""progressive"" 
stance towards history, and the picturesque, yet again, helps 
organise nationalist sentiment. Thus, though the novel did not,

early 19th century representations of India. The paper shows that this 
continuity was maintained by appropriating and transforming earlier 
representations. 2 This novel was, incidentally, re-published in 1857 with slight revisions

Already in one province, with a view to stop the further effusion of blood 
and to hasten the pacification of our Indian dominions, our viceroy and 
governor-general has held our the expectation of pardon, on certain terms, 
to the great majority of those who in late unhappy disturbances have been 
guilty of offences against our government and has declared the punish­
ment which will be inflicted on those whose crimes place them beyond the 
reach of forgiveness"". 'Proclamation by the Queen (of England) in Council, 
To the Princes, Chiefs, and People of India', November 1858, Freedom 
Struggle in Uttar Pradesh (FSUP), Vol 2, Rizvi, Bhargava (eds), pp 526-27. 4 This is taken from Hazrat Mahal's proclamation. The sentence, of which 
this quote forms a part, reads as: ""If the Queen has assumed the 
government, why does Her Majesty not restore our country to us when our 
people wish it? It is well known that no king or queen ever punished a 
whole army and people for rebellion; all were forgiven; and the wise 
cannot approve of punishing the whole army and people of Hindustan""

it is crucially tied to the law. It is this that makes it a political ritual. As he 
elaborates: ""We must regard the public execution, as it was still ritualised 
in the 18th century, as a political operation. It was logically inscribed in a 
system of punishment, in which the sovereign, directly or indirectly,

also worth quoting: ""An event, consequently, is not a decision, a treaty, a 
reign, or a battle, but the reversal of a relationship of forces, the usurpation

historical moment of the nationalist present), and the future. 10 Immediately following this scene, Seeta and Grace each throw a garland 
into the river, which according to local custom, will sink or swim deciding 
the fulfilment or denial or a person's wishes. Grace's garland, predictably 
swims and Seeta's sinks, reinforcing the fact that it is the land that 
ultimately and in each instance denies the Indians' claims and wishes, and

few colonial novels of the 19th and very early 20th centuries 
which touch upon the subject of the rani and the theme of the 
Rebellion of 1857. It seeks to probe the diversities of represen­

were written during the period 1870s to 1900. These texts are by 
no means approached as ""accurate"" portrayals of the rani; rather 
they are ""constructions"", or ideologically-loaded projections of 
reality instead of ""reflections"" of reality. As ideologically loaded 
portrayals of the rani these narratives perhaps reveal more about 
colonial perceptions than they do about their subject and in the 
process throw light on shifting colonial attitudes and ideologies. THE MUTINY NOVEL 
Arguably, the Rebellion of 1857, termed the ""Epic of the 
Race"" by the Victorians, was a landmark historical event that 
impacted 19th century colonial literary writing; it created the 
genre of the ""Mutiny novel"" which was hugely popular both in 
colonial India and in metropolitan Britain. 1 The event became 
the single most inspiring theme in fiction from the 1860s until the 
turn of the century (and through the 20th century as well) so that 
even 40 years later, colonial novelist Hilda Gregg could observe 
in a review article 'The Indian Mutiny in Fiction' in Blackwood's 
Edinburgh Magazine in 1897: ""Of all the great events of this 
century as they are reflected in fiction, the Indian Mutiny has 
taken the firmest hold on the popular imagination"".2 Written 
initially by India-based colonialists such as military officers and 
civil administrators, the genre enjoyed such instant success and
254 
7 857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
wide readership that popular authors in the metropole too, like 
G A Henty among others, churned out numerous romances on 
this theme.3 The strategic importance of this genre and its enormous 
popularity can be traced to post-""Mutiny"" insecurities and 
anxieties and therefore the need to present epic narratives of 
British heroics and the solidarity of colonisers. The majority of 
these novels were romances of love and adventure which 
marked a clear polarisation between lndiansfmutineers"" and 
the British, feeding into myths pertaining to race, culture, 
sexuality, power and gender. Racial and cultural stereotypes 
predominated, such as Asiatic cruelty, treachery, lechery (parti­
cularly towards white women) and British courage, manliness 
and the chivalric protection of women. Thus, this genre essentially had the objective of establishing 
the moral as well as military superiority of the British.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=295

circulating images and stereotypes about the ""Mutiny"", colonial 
fiction such as these texts served to produce and circulate 
""colonial knowledge"" about the events of 1857, the role of 
Indians, including rebel leaders, such as the rani of Jhansi in it, 
as well as the heroism of their own people, the British in India. LAKSHMIBAI IN COLONIAL HISTORICAL DISCOURSE Of all the rebel leaders who participated in the Rebellion, it 
was undoubtedly Lakshmibai, the rani ofJhansi, who fired the 
imagination of these authors. The colonial imagination was 
fascinated by the image of the fearless warrior woman who had 
fought with such audacious courage in battle. Colonial discur­
sive writings on the ""Mutiny"" tended to imagine her in a manner 
that was quite distinct from other rebel leaders. Not only was she 
one of the few prominent female rebel leaders, but her story had 
many more romantic twists and turns in English eyes. Several theories about the Revolt abounded in the 19th 
century colonial mind. It was variously held to have been 
caused by religious fears of conversion, by sepoy unrest, 
disaffection among the peasants and talukdars - and not least of 
all, by a yearning for lost power among the ""native"" princes. According to this perception, ""native"" rulers who held a grudge 
against the British, such as the Mahratta Nana Sahib of Satara
Inscribing the Rani of Jhansi in Colonial 'Mutiny' Fiction 255 
and Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, as well as other well known 
leaders like the moulvi of Faizabad, Firuz Shah, Tantia Tope, 
Rao Sahib and Kunwar Singh, had all come together under the 
overall symbolic leadership of the erstwhile Mughal emperor at 
Delhi in order to re-install the old political order. In the historical real, Lakshmibai was born to poor Brahmin 
parents, Moropant Tambe and his wife Bhagirathi Bai. Her 
early life was spent in Benaras, Bithur and Bundelkhand where 
-she was brought up with boys. One of her childhood playmates 
was her cousin, Nana Sahib.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=296

-she was brought up with boys. One of her childhood playmates 
was her cousin, Nana Sahib. She thus received training early in 
her childhood in horse-riding, fencing, wrestling, hand-to-hand 
fight and firing guns. 4 She became the second wife of Gangadhar 
Rao, the Maratha ruler of Jhansi whose family were traditionally 
British loyalists. Continuing this loyalist tradition, she was at first 
grateful to the English for preserving and augmenting the 
dynasty. But when Gangadhar Rao died in 1853, the British 
refused to recognise Damodar Rao, the raja's adopted son as the 
heir and successor in accordance with Hindu tradition and 
Dalhousie, the governor-general, annexed the state of Jhansi 
under the doctrine of lapse. Lakshmibai even hired a British 
lawyer to appeal her case in London. However, although these 
petitions were well-argued, they were ultimately rejected and 
the rani joined the Rebellion when the rebels reachedjhansi. The role of the rani in the Rebellion has been the subject of 
great debate among modern historians, as perhaps has been the 
nature of the Rebellion itself. Nationalist historians, who some­
times term the Rebellion the ""first war of independence"" have 
traditionally tried to paint the rani as fiercely anti-British and anti­
colonial and tried to appropriate her as a symbol of""nationalism"" and 
patriotic resistance. Other historians like R C Majumdar have 
rescued her from the ""nationalist"" paradigm and revealed her to 
be more of a ""reluctant rebel"", who joined the mutineers 
because of English intransigence in coming to her assistance. Majumdar noted that the rani ""had to carry on a fight against her 
own kinsmen and rival Indian chiefs, and to the very last, i e, till 
at least March 1858 when the curtain was slowly falling over the 
great drama in north India, she was yet undecided whether she

out that long after the rebels had occupied and lost Delhi in
256 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
February 1858, the rani was still sending despatches to the local 
British for help. However, historians of all leanings are united in 
praising the heroism and courage with which she ultimately 
faced the English troops. Moreover, Roy also praises her ability 
to infuse loyalty in such diverse groups as the Bundela rajputs, 
Maratha brahmins, Afghan mercenaries and rebellious 
'purabiya' soldiers. Whatever the details might have been in reality, the fact 
remains that her successful attempt to resist relatives who staked 
their claims to the throne, her spirited efforts to restore her 
adopted son and assert her right over Jhansi have all been justly 
admired. Even more laudable was the will-power and determi­
nation that she displayed in resisting the governor-general's 
rejection of her appeals - a determination summed up in her 
famed, although possibly apocryphal declaration, 'Meinjhansi 
nahi doongi' (I will not give up Jhansi). Colonial discussions about the rani essentially tended to 
focus on two aspects. The first was whether she had in fact been 
driven to revolt by the unfair treatment meted out to her by the 
British, culminating in the annexation ofjhansi. In other words, 
colonial discourse was often troubled by the awareness that the 
rani, who had been a loyal ally of the colonial government had 
been deeply wronged by them in this entire sordid saga of 
annexation.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=298

George Malleson wrote in their History of the Indian Mutiny 
(1896), ""Whatever her faults in British eyes may have been, her 
countrymen will ever believe that she was driven by ill-treatment 
into rebellion; that her cause was a righteous cause"", they were 
giving voice to this collective British guilt. 6 The second question which evoked strong reactions among 
the British was whether she had been responsible for the massacre 
of about 60 English men, women and children who had taken 
shelter in one of the forts at Jhansi. These Europeans had later 
been killed after being promised safe conduct and the incident 
was regarded as an act of treacherous cruelty. In the colonial 
imagination this event stood second in its perfidy only to the 
Satichaura Ghat and Bibighar incidents at Cawnpore (Kanpur). Nevertheless, she was not perceived as unambiguously ""evil"" 
as Nana Sahib to whom she was related.7 After all, Nana Sahib, 
called the ""butcher of Cawnpore"" by the colonialists, was
Inscribing the Rani of Jhansi in Colonial 'Mutiny' Fiction 257 
defined in the colonial imagination by the Satichaura Ghat 
incident where European men, women and children had been 
fired at and the Bibighar massacre of white women and children, 
supposedly at his orders. While colonialists no doubt located 
Lakshmibai as an ""enemy"", who they believed was responsible 
for the Jhansi massacre, they nevertheless, simultaneously tended 
to view her in a more nuanced manner, as also a tragic figure 
who had been a victim of colonial policies of annexation and the 
doctrine of lapse. In any case, controversy surrounded the incident of the 
massacre in colonial discursive writings. The rani always main­
tained that she was innocent of these killings but her protesta­
tions of innocence were never accepted by the British. Subse­

TA Martin subsequently wrote a letter to the rani's son, 
Damodar Rao, saying that she ""took no part whatever in the 
massacre of the European residents of Jhansi in June 1857. On 
the contrary, she supplied them with food for two days after they 
had gone into the fort"".9 However, such testimonies were 
generally disregarded in the post-""Mutiny"" revenge hysteria, 
and, generally speaking, the rani entered colonial memory as a 
cruel ""unwomanly"" killer of innocent women and children. On the other hand, the topic of the rani' s valour and courage 
did find mention in many colonial writings. One of the greatest 
admirers of the rani' s heroism was in fact the British officer who 
led the attack on her army in 1858 near Gwalior. General Hugh 
Rose, who was responsible for her defeat, termed her the 
""Indianjoan of Arc"" and showered the highest praise on her as 
the ""best and bravest of the rebel leaders"", going on to add that 
""the Indian Mutiny has produced but one man, and that man 
was a woman"".10 Indeed, his description of her appearance at 
that historic moment of her death later created what became the 
iconic image of the valorous warrior-queen: seated on horse­
back, clad in male clothes, sword held high. Rose noted: ""The 
Rani of Jhansi ... was killed in this charge, dressed in a red jacket, 
red trousers, and white puggery; she wore the celebrated pearl 
necklace of Scindia which she had taken from his treasury, and 
heavy gold anklets"". 258

Early imperial ""Mutiny historians"", like John Kaye and 
George Malleson too generally tended to echo this perception 
about her bravery. In their History of the Indian Mutiny (1896), 
they described her as ""the resolute woman, who alike in council 
and on the field, was the soul of the conspirators. Clad in the 
attire of a man and mounted on horse back, the rani of Jhansi 
might have been seen animating her troops through the day.""11

the hearts of the people.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=300

Thus, in multifarious ways, the colonial imagination was 
fascinated by the image of the fearless warrior queen. Her 
heroic, larger-than-life image loomed over colonial discursive 
writings for the next few decades. British admiration in fact 
coincided with Indian valorisation of her legendary heroism -
voiced in innumerable tales, poems, songs and folklore, includ­
ing Hindi poet Subhadra Kumari Chauhan's famed poem with 
its refrain, 'khub larhi mardani woh to Jhansi wali rani thi' 
(Bravely fought the warrior queen of Jhansi). 13 
V ALORISING THE RANI: 
PHILIP MEADOWS TAYLOR'S MUTINY NOVEL SEETA (1872) 
Possibly one of the most significant among the colonial 
novels of the 1870s was Philip Meadows Taylor's ""Mutiny"" 
novel, Seeta (1872). Although the novel's plot centred around 
the inter-racial love between the eponymous Hindu widow 
heroine and a British administrator against the background of 
the Revolt of 1857, it dealt closely with the theme of the 
Rebellion and addressed a number of issues connected with it, 
including the heightened racism that preceded the outbreak as 
well as local anger against interference with social customs 
pertaining to Indian women. 14 In addition, it presented a rare, 
admiring inscription of the rani as a valorous and wronged 
woman, drawing upon the trope of the warrior-woman or 
'virangana'. In fact, the relative sensitivity with which Taylor 
approached many of the issues has led a present-day scholar like

As a leading colonial writer, Taylor was distinguished from 
his contemporary administrator-novelists by his benevolent, 
paternalistic admiration for Indian culture. Although he report­
edly used his influence in the Berar region to avert a breakout 
of the rebellion and later helped the colonial troops with cattle 
and supplies, he was, at the same time, extremely critical of the 
East India Company's policies. In his Students' Manual of 
the History of India (1870) he declared that the ""Koompany 
Bahadur'' (East India Company) was in a state of moral decline 
and criticised the tampering with the hereditary privileges of 
the ""talookdars of Oudh"" (Awadh) and confiscation of their 
property by English settlement officers. 16 In particular, he felt 
special sympathy for rani ""Lukshmee Bye"" and strongly 
censured the manner in which Jhansi, traditionally loyal to the 
British, had been annexed under the Doctrine of Lapse. In the 
subsequent period of British reprisals that followed, Taylor 
supported Canning's policy of clemency and maintained that 
""as almost indiscriminate slaughter was carried on, that restraint 
was needed"" (ibid, p 748). Taylor bears a broad resemblance (without any actual links) 
to the group known as the ""British Orientalists"" which had 
consisted of scholars like William Jones and H T Colebrooke in 
the late 18th and early 19th centuries, who had contributed to 
the notion of a golden Vedic age and glorified India's ancient 
history. During this period, i e, the 1860s and 1870s there seems 
to have been an interest in an old tradition in Indian history and 
literature of the noble warrior woman with her martial prowess.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=302

to have been an interest in an old tradition in Indian history and 
literature of the noble warrior woman with her martial prowess. An article in The Calcutta Review in 1869 drew attention to what 
it termed as ""the utter blank in the history of the female sex"". 17 
In a list of heroic queens which included ""Baiza Baiee"", it 
mentioned the ""Ranee of Jhansi"" and praised her as ""a woman 
of high spirit and conspicuous talent"". In much the same vein, the image of the female fighter found 
valorisation in a romantic novel Bismillah (1869) written by 
colonial novelist ""Hafiz"" Allard. Although not otherwise on the 
subject of the Rebellion, it paid tribute to the courage of royal 
women like ""the Queen of Jhansi, who died fighting gallantly
260

Mahal, whom it described as belonging to a hoary and noble line 
of ""aspiring women"" .18 
With his fascination for Indian history, Taylor too often drew 
upon this tradition of warrior-queens who had fought off en­
emies in order to save the land and the people. 19 Many of his 
novels inscribe this favourite female prototype of his. In The 
Noble Queen (1878), for instance, he valorised ""Chand Beebee"", 
the 16th century queen of Bijapur as seated on horseback, 
""familiar with war"", firm and dignified, yet kind and benevolent, 
and presented her as an inspiring ideal from the past. 20

Rebellion, he describes the rani as ""fair and handsome: with a 
noble presence and figure, and a dignified and resolute, indeed 
stern, expression.""21 She is figured as an efficient ruler who sits 
""on the seat, or Guddee, of her deceased husband"", spending her 
day ""receiving reports, giving directions, hearing petitions, and 
comporting herself as a brave and determined woman had need 
to do in her position"" (p 408). In fact, with his deep sympathy for the rani, he projects her 
as a victim of British injustice and even betrayal. As she points 
out in an emotional outburst in the novel: ""We loved the 
English; we hoisted their flag over our own, and it would have 
been there now, had their old justice been continued to us"" 
(p 411). She complains bitterly against her acquisitive English 
adversaries who have ""all the empire of Dehly belonging to 
them"" and yet have greedily ""refused to continue what they 
themselves had once granted to us"" (p 411). In other words, the narrative unequivocally blames British 
policies for the rani's transformation from friend to unforgiving 
foe. The text notes that ""the people speak of her as gentle and 
loving once; but the English have wronged her deeply and she has 
thrown away her scabbard"" (ibid, p 412). The result is that she is 
changed into ""a very tigress at heart"" (ibid, p 412), ""brooding over 
her wrongs and her revenge, gloomy and vindictive"" (ibid, p 412). However, notwithstanding his deep sympathy for the rani,

sible for the massacre of the Europeans at the Fort.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=304

not one!"" (p 411) of the English men, women and children. But 
at the same time the text seeks to attenuate her guilt by 
reminding us that this had been done in angry reprisal against 
British injustice. As she exclaims: 
I, weak woman as I am, would have fought for them. No harm should 
have come near them that I, LukshmEe Bye, could have prevented. I 
would have taken those Englishwomen and their babes to my breast 
and held them there, truly and safely; while their husbands should have 
kept them and me against all enemies. Yes, I would have done this ... 
if they had been true (p 410). The narrative closes with an adulatory account of her valor­
ous death in combat. Pointing out that ""in the subsequent 
operations"" she ""proved to be the most untiring, and 
perhaps the ablest of the rebel leaders"" (p 415), it describes 
how, at the end, ""she, and her sister, or companion, were 
slain, being dressed like men, in a charge by the 8th 
Hussars"" (pp 415-16). Taylor, attempting accuracy, quotes 
Hugh Rose's famed words and salutes ""the Ranee of Jhansy, 
who, although a lady, was the ablest and bravest military leader 
of the rebels"" (p 416). Taylor's inscription of the rani in his ""Mutiny"" novel Seeta

Indian history with a strand drawn from contemporary imperial 
historiography which saluted the rani's valour. His novels are

negative representations of the rani were also found, as in 
Charles Ball's famous History of the Indian Mutiny (1859) where 
the sketch, 'Massacre of English Officers and Their Wives at 
Jhansi' graphically depicted the agony of white women tied to 
trees, their clothes slashed off by sepoys. 22In fact, over the next 
decade the image of the rani was generally scripted negatively 
in colonial discursive writings and later reports and accounts
262 
1857: Essays Fom Ec onomic and Political Weekly 
tended to demonise the rebel queen. These later accounts of the 
1880s and 1890s tended to dismiss Hugh Rose's adulatory 
descriptions of her valour by remarking that she was ""just the 
sort of daredevil woman soldiers admire"".23 A report in The 
Bombay Times in 1885 described her as a Jezebel, as a handsome 
but lascivious she-fiend. It painted a lurid picture of her ordering 
her sepoys to humiliate and torture the white prisoners before 
killing them: Shortly after, the whole of the European community, men, women, and 
children, were forcibly brought out of their homes; and, in presence of 
the Ranee, stripped naked. Then commenced a scene unparalleled in 
historical annals. She, who styles herself as ""Ranee"", ordered ... their

directed the innocent little children to be hacked to pieces before the 
eyes of their agonised parents, she gave the women into the hands of 
the rebel sepoys, to be dishonoured first by them, and then handed 
over to the rabble ... those who still lingered were put to death with the 
greatest cruelty, being severed limb from limb.24 
Later popular ""histories"" of the Rebellion of the late 19th and 
early 20th centuries too often cast a slur on the rani's ""moral"" 
character, as for instance George W Forrest's History of

""intemperate"" and ""licentious"" and also referred to her as the

cially the perceived role of Indian women in the ""Mutiny"" needs 
to be mentioned. ""Mutiny""-related constructions about ""native"" 
women - prostitute or princess - were that they were cruel and 
treacherous. Prostitutes who were believed to have instigated 
the sepoys into revolt, ""taunting them with their failure"", were 
cited as examples of ""native"" female cruelty. 26The British 
newspaper News of the World condemned them as ""active 
instigators of the sepoys in their worst atrocities"". 27 The 
colonial ""Mutiny"" novel too often represented begums and 
ranis stereotypically as licentious, manipulative, or sexually 
voracious. Constructions about Lakshmibai too need to be located 
within this larger framework of race, class and gender 
perceptions. Representations of women in ""Mutiny"" writings 
tended to graft stereotypes about uncontrolled Indian female

sexuality/sensuality with that of ""native"" cruelty. The literary 
inscriptions of the rani which abound in a number of ""Mutiny"" 
novels - either through passing references or through 
detailed inscriptions - figure her as cruel and heartless, 
mocking at the white women in her captivity, or as lascivious 
and hungry for lovers. In some narratives she is figured as

Revolt. Written almost a decade after Philip Meadows Taylor's 
""Mutiny"" novel, it inscribes the rani as cruel, unscrupulous 
and ready to use her sexuality to manipulate her white enemies. Maclean figures ""Rane Luchmie Bhie of Ranepore"" as 
possessing ""a character better known for evil than for good"".28 
While the novel does concede that she was politically ill­
treated by the British colonial government, it indicates that 
she was, in any case, fundamentally evil: ""Bad, however as she 
was, she might have pleaded ... that the treatment she had 
undergone ... was such as was calculated more to develop the 
evil that was in her, than the good"" (p 16). But this tacit 
admission of British role in her revolt is not meant to mitigate 
her actions in any way. At the novel's opening, the dying ruler of ""Ranepore"" Ghansi), 
""Rajah Gungadhar Row"" who is greatly ""respected and loved by 
his subjects"" (p 16) confides in ""Shakespear"", the British politi­
cal officer at his court, with whom he has ""a genuine and cordial 
friendship"" (ibid, p 16), that his third wife, Luchmie Bhie is cruel 
and unscrupulous and should not succeed as ruler after his 
death. By projecting the old raja's dying wish to be that the rani 
should not be made the ruler or regent, the text erases the 
potentially weakest link in the rani of Jhansi case, viz, the 
possibility of her being perceived as a victim of British injustice. In short, the narrative makes annexation and the Doctrine of

from head to foot, disguised as a man seeking an appointment 
- only to dramatically reveal herself, in all her dazzling beauty: It was a face, which, when once seen, it would be difficult to forget, with 
jet-black liquid eyes, fringed with long sweeping eyelashes; a forehead 
giving promise of intelligence and determination; a beautifully chis­
elled aquiline nose, and a small exquisitely shaped mouth, but one 
which, if closely observed and studied, would give the idea that its 
possessor could be cruel and unsparing (23). While the narrative does draw attention to the hints of cruelty 
on her face, her powerful sexuality exercises such a ""magnetic 
influence"" (p 25) on the political agent, that ""[his] beautiful 
companion's touch and near proximity sent a thrill of feeling

projected the colonisers as dispensers of justice in the colonies 
and also as chivalric and knightly, protectors of women. 29

""moral"" character does not extend beyond this incident; in 
other words, it is not an uncontrollable sexuality, but a coldly 
calculated deployment of her sexuality for political gains that 
motivates her in this novel. The rani's political machinations, 
however, eventually bear no fruit, since Shakespear's role as 
political agent comes to an abrupt end, with a serious hunting 
accident the very next morning in which he suffers a concussion 
and proceeds to England on sick leave - with a new political 
officer named Plowden replacing him. It is important to note that it is not for licentiousness but for 
cruelty and ruthlessness that the rani is critiqued in this narra­
tive. The climax of her ill-deeds are centred around her ordering 
the massacre on the ""fatal morning of the eighth of June 1857""

instances vented its rage and hatred, by hellish acts of cruelty almost 
unheard of, seizing helpless infants and children by the limbs, and -
even before their mothers' eyes- dashing out their brains against the stone 
wall surrounding the garden where the massacre took place (pp 228-29). The novel ends on an almost hysterical note; as the Rebellion 
is quelled, the rebels scattered and the cruel rani killed, what 
remains is the abiding image of a memorial to the dead of Jhansi 
""a tablet to their memory was erected to mark a spot quite as 
tragical and as well worthy a place in history as the well known 
blood-stained well of Cawnpore"" (p 23 l). As Patrick Brantlinger 
has observed, the famous well at Cawnpore carried special 
resonance in colonial ""Mutiny"" iconography; thus, by invoking 
the image of the well, ""Gillean's"" novel seeks to elevate the 
massacre at Jhansi to the same level. 30

THE QUEEN'S DESIRE (1893) BY HUME NISBET The 1890s was the phase of ""New Imperialism"" which was 
marked by a cultural privileging of forcefulness and virile 
masculinity. In addition, there was also an incipient heightened 
racism, as is suggested by Joseph Chamberlain's statement, 
""I believe in this race, the greatest governing race ... which will 
infallibly be the predominating force of future history and 
universal civilisation"". 32The relationship between coloniser and 
colonised was being re-cast as one based not on consent but on 
masculine force. Moreover, as Nancy Paxton points out in her 
reading of a few ""Mutiny"" novels of the 1890s which delineate 
the rani, that the phase of ""New Imperialism"" was both sexist 
and racist. The 1890s saw a heightened activity in terms of the produc­
tion of the ""Mutiny"" novel, with as many as 19 novels being 
published. In a recent study on ""Mutiny"" fiction Gautam 
Chakravarty notes that ""the novels of the nineties say a good 
deal about the British self-image in India, as they are among the 
indices of a high imperial culture"".33 He points out that ""the 
rebellion now turns into a site of heroic imperial adventure, and 
an occasion for conspicuous demonstrations of racial superior­
ity"" (p 17).",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=312

literary texts of the 1850s and 1870s project white people 
sometimes as victim, whereas later novels of the New Imperial­
ism phase of the 1890s tend to valorise British power and 
agency. Conversely, in order to underline British heroic agency, 
it becomes equally necessary to negate or undermine the valour 
of the ""native"" mutineers. It has also been rightly pointed out that the rani's courage and 
valour were ""troublesome to triumphal British histories"". 34 
Thus, in a romance of the 1890s, The Queen's Desire: A Romance 
of the Indian Mutiny (1893) written by Hume Nisbet, a metro­
politan adventure-fiction writer, textual strategies of representa­
tion are directed at disempowering the warrior rani. In the
Inscribing the Rani of Jhansi in Colonial 'Mutiny' Fiction 267 
colonial imaginary colonised women were eroticised as sexually 
compliant, excitingly sensual, subservient and eager to please. Written almost 40 years after the Revolt of 1857 this novel 
figures the rani as sensual and promiscuous, thereby feeding 
into these colonial myths of ""native"" female sensuality and 
subservience. Her first appearance in the text is a dramatic one. As a group 
of rowdy British soldiers try to sexually molest some ""native"" 
women accompanying a palanquin ('palki') in old 
Delhi, a woman - who unknown to them, is the rani - emerges 
from inside the palki. Her appearance at first spells eastern 
sensuality, she is scripted as a glorified dancing-girl or courte­
san, wearing a ""rich nautch-dress, with its flashing jewels ... and 
gold-spangled gauze veil which floats about her in the night 
air"". 35 However, this sensual image is complicated soon after by 
one of martial spiritedness, as with a swift movement this 
warrior-woman cuts off the head of one of the assailants with 
her 'tulwar'.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=313

Sergeant George Jackson, the novel's lower-class hero and 
confines him in a dungeon, but soon finds him so sexually 
irresistible that she transforms the underground chamber into a 
sensual love-nest - where she even dances like a nautch-girl for 
his entertainment. Colonial novels were often undergirded by 
fantasies of race, class, sexuality, gender and power, where 
Indian beloveds of white males often embodied the colonised 
land itself, emotionally and sexually conquered. 3G In this novel too, in an inversion of power-relationships, the 
besotted rani is erotically subjugated by her mad infatuation for 
the low-class Englishman, to the extent that she even wishes to 
marry him. By scriptingJackson's mastery over the rani who is 
both queen and foremost female rebel leader, the narrative 
seeks to privilege British masculinities and its agency over 
Indian feminine passivity. Furthermore, like other ""Mutiny"" 
narratives delineating Indian princes, this text too seeks to 
establish the ""native"" rulers' moral, sexual, racial inferiority and 
to inscribe the Rebellion as a triumph of the ""middle class"" 
colonisers over ""oriental voluptuaries"". 37 
However, despite her infatuation for this low-born English­
man, the rani's resolve to fight the British does not in any way

lessen, neither does her inveterate hatred for them as she 
actively conspires with Nana Sahib, the Mughal badshah in 
Delhi and the Maulvi of Fazabad to kill the British. Indeed, after 
Jackson's interest in her - which is merely sexual 
lessens, he 
manages to get away from her and it is much later that he, now 
married to an English girl, encounters the rani on the battlefield 
at the siege ofGwalior. Not recognising her, clad as she in ""chain

narratives delineating Indian princes, this text too seeks to 
establish the ""native"" rulers' moral, sexual, racial inferiority and

lessen, neither does her inveterate hatred for them as she 
actively conspires with Nana Sahib, the Mughal badshah in 
Delhi and the Maulvi of Fazabad to kill the British. Indeed, after 
Jackson's interest in her - which is merely sexual 
lessens, he 
manages to get away from her and it is much later that he, now 
married to an English girl, encounters the rani on the battlefield 
at the siege ofGwalior. Not recognising her, clad as she in ""chain 
armour"" (p 305), with ""her head covered with a golden helmet 
crowned with blazing jewels"" (ibid, p 305), he kills her in combat 
and it is her dying words that reveal her real identity: The lovely dark eyes opened as he uncovered that beautiful face and 
the lips that had once so passionately kissed him smiled again tenderly, 
as she said faintly ... ""Your wife, George your first wife, my lord and 
master. She who was the Ranee ofjhansi, and gave you her heart to 
split"" (p 306). In 19th century colonial discourse the image of the devoted 
Indian wife and ""native"" wifely sacrifice occupied a special 
place. The narrative thus transforms the legendary warrior­
queen, celebrated for her valour, into an abandoned wife, a 
love-sick woman, dying, unrequited in love: That passionate, erring, but human heart had pumped out its last drop, 
and George Jackson, the heir to the Rajah's fortune, held in his arms 
the inanimate remains of what had been a queen (p 307). As he kills her unwittingly, he is overcome with guilt; ""a 
mighty trembling"" falls upon him, as ""for the first time ... he felt 
like a murderer, and grew weak with the horror of the situation"" 
(p 306). Thus the novel locates the rani within the dual constructs of 
excitingly sensual ""native"" mistress and faithful Indian wife. By 
the novel's end the sensual mistress has seamlessly changed into 
the 'pativrata' ( devoted wife), the faithful, even abject, Indian 
wife, for whom death is all the sweeter if it is at her lord's hands. Furthermore, the narrative valorises English male agency and 
Eastern female passivity by showing the defeat of the rani twice 
over at the hands of the novel's hero; she is first erotically 
""conquered"" by him and later this great female warrior is

negatively in much of the colonial (and metropolitan) fiction
Inscribing the Rani of Jhansi in Colonial 'Mutiny' Fiction 269 
from the decade of the 1860s down to the 1890s. Successive 
novels seemed to have inscribed her in ever-darker shades of 
moral obliquity. However, there is by no means a linear or 
schematic pattern of increasing moral degradation in the textual 
representation of the rani through 30-odd years which constitute 
the period we are looking at. On the contrary, within this pattern 
one finds contradictions, ambiguities and complexities that 
arguably prevent a linear reading of these texts. 'NATIONALIST' VIRANGANA: 
THE JEANNE D'ARC OF INDIA (1901) BY MICHAEL WHITE A striking case in point is an adulatory turn-of-the-century 
novel, Lachmi Bai, Rani of Jhansi: The Jeanne D'Arc of India 
( 1901). Published in the US rather than in Britain like most 
colonial fiction and authored by Michael White (possibly an 
American), it is understandably less rooted than most ""Mutiny"" 
novels in British colonial perceptions and prejudices. In this 
highly romanticised text ""Lachmi Bai, the disinherited Rani of 
Jhansi"" (p 4) is figured as a young and beautiful princess who 
had been ""affianced"" (that is to say, only betrothed, and not 
married) to the late raja and ""deprived ... of my inheritance of 
the throne of Jhansi"" (p 15).38 In retelling the history of the rani. the text transforms her from 
the dignified, widowed queen of historical accounts into a 
dazzling young unmarried ""princess"", who combines ""beauty 
and high spirit"" (p 110) and is proclaimed ""Rani of Jhansi"" by 
her adoring people and - after her brief power struggle with one 
of her own officers - it is spontaneously declared that the ""Raj 
is the Rani's"" (p 35).",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=316

British Commissioner negotiating with her at the beginning 
soon discovers - ""a strength of character emphasised in every 
line of her distinctly Aryan features, a force of will ... warning him 
at the outset that he had to deal with no shrinking, simple, 
zanana maiden"" (p 11). It is striking that the rani - despite several ardent admirers -
remains sexually chaste and celibate. This is in sharp contrast to 
the images of licentiousness that, as we saw, ""Mutiny"" fiction 
usually scripted around her. In fact her celibacy is juxtaposed 
with the indolent sensuality of the ""volupti.lous .. .ladies of the

""inclined to regard her as a bold creature of less than doubtful 
virtue, otherwise she could not consort so openly with men"" 
(ibid, p 259). She is said to be ""far removed from the generally 
accepted type of her countrywomen"" (p 11) and her rejection of 
purdah and her free interactions with her people displays far 
""greater personal freedom"" than was traditionally observed 
even ""on the part of the Maratha ladies"" (p 110). Most importantly perhaps from a western perspective, the 
narrative absolves the rani altogether of the massacre of 
the Europeans - something which even Taylor's otherwise 
adulatory novel had not done. The killing is attributed to one of 
her treacherous officers who had given false assurances of 
""protection"" in her name - and had been believed by the

learns about the incident, the rani with ""her womanly repug­
nance to ruthless slaughter"" (p 25), reacts with dismay: ""To kill 
the innocent, the already defeated, did not occupy a thought 
in her mind. The news came swift and ominous ... a tragedy 
taken place"" (ibid, p 25). The narrative does detail the pathos of their death but unlike 
in many lurid ""Mutiny"" accounts including the 1880s ""eyewit­
ness"" report in The Bombay Times mentioned earlier in this paper 
- the incident is delineated with restraint: Then ... they marched out to a field nearby, a pitiful, defenseless band, 
of men, women, and children. The sun never shone upon a more 
brutal tragedy. Beside a clump of trees all were ruthlessly butchered. Their honour 
alone was spared. Without a plea for mercy, without a cry of anguish, 
these heroes met a cruel fate, that might have been averted by a less 
exacting government (pp 23-24). As the events of the novel unfurl, and intrigue follows 
counter-intrigue inside the rebel camp, the rani's courage im­
presses even her enemies, such as the pro-British Mahratta ruler 
Sindhia: ""During the year past, Sindhia had heard much of the 
redoubtable Princess ofjhansi. He had been told of her beauty, 
her wisdom, and her valor"" (p 248). Indeed, later on when the

in council than the Maid of Orleans"" (ibid), and realise that 
she has ""cast in their teeth a wager of defiance, to stand until 
either they were driven from her state, or she had perished"" 
(ibid, p 287). This image of the warrior woman is overtly drawn from 
western chivalric traditions and the paradigm of warrior-maid­
ens in European history. In particular, it invokes the 15th 
century Frenchjoan of Arc, who had fought the English at the 
end of the Hundred Years' War. Interestingly, the novel's 
subtitle carries echoes from General Hugh Rose's terming the 
rani ''. Joan of Arc"" in his account written nearly 50 years ago. Besides this symbolism, also reproduced in the text is general 
Rose's iconic description of the rani clad in red-coloured male 
attire and wearing a white ""puggery"". When she joins the rebel 
leaders Rao Sahib and Tantia Topi at Kalpi in the novel she 
appears dressed as ""a young officer"" with a ""white turban"" and 
""attired in a blood-red uniform from head to foot"" (p 212). In fact, this trope of the fearless female fighter also situates her 
firmly in the tradition of the virangana, the warrior princess. After 30 years since Taylor's 1870s novel Seeta, the trope of the 
rani as virangana is foregrounded in this text; she is a skilled 
horsewoman, she longs ""[t]o be a man and ride forth sword in

appears as ""one of those intrepid Maratha warriors, who had 
defied the power of the great Mogul"" (ibid, p 255). However, in reifying the image of the warrior woman, there 
is one significant difference; while Taylor had presented her 
as a mature woman, stem and dignified, Michael White's novel 
re-casts her as a young, warrior-""maiden"", an unmarried princess 
(the betrothed, not the wife, of the dead raja) whose virginity in 
fact remains intact since her love for Prasad, a young Hindu 
aristocrat remains ""noble"" and unconsummated till the end. Indeed, this image of the female fighter is multilayered and 
can be read as also carrying resonances of India's anti-imperialist

struggle. Historically, the early 20th century saw the emergence 
of a militant nationalism in Bengal and elsewhere. By underlin­
ing the rani's chastity and celibacy, the text feeds into what one 
may call the trope of the ""celibate warrior"", the image of which

awe inspiring figure"" (ibid, p 259). Thus, interestingly enough, the figuration of the rani in this 
novel feeds into what may be called an ""Indian Nationalist"" 
paradigm of patriotism and anti-colonial struggle. Indeed, at the 
end, when the rani lies mortally wounded in her tent, her dying 
words express a ""passionate love for her country"" (p 287), as she 
bids farewell in a patriotic outburst, "" 'O India,' she cried ... 
'farewell' "" (p 295), prophesying a future of liberation from 
colonial domination:"" 'A day will come when their law shall be 
no longer obeyed, and our temples and palaces rise anew from 
their ruins' "" (p 295). Although, as historians point out, the 
concept of ""India"" as a ""nation"" did not exist in 1857, the period 
of the tum of the 20th century when this novel was written ( 1901, 
to be precise), did in fact witness an intensification in the 
Indian national movement, culminating in the partition of Bengal 
in 1905. By figuring the rani as voicing patriotic sentiments for 
""India"" rather than love for Jhansi alone ('MeinJhansi nahi

the narrative does seem to gesture at a conceptualisation of the 
""Mutiny"" as the ""First War of Independence"".40

Inscribing the Rani of Jhansi in Colonial 'Mutiny' Fiction 273 The rani' s death itself is mystic and spiritual, rather in 
keeping with European chivalric traditions of the west; mortally 
wounded, she is laid, at her request, to die quietly alone in her 
tent with the request that ""no Foreign eye doth gaze upon my 
body after I am dead"" (p 294): In a little, a wail of lamentation rose across the intervening space 
between the camps of the two armies. The Foreign soldiers asked its 
meaning of one another. The answer might have been that the spirit of the heroic Lachmi Bai had 
been gathered to the protecting arms of Parameswara, the merciful, the 
just, the all supreme God, alike of the Hindu, the Mohammedan, and 
the Christian. The Rani ofJhansi was dead (pp 295-296). Thus, as we have seen, Michael White's strikingly unconven­
tional novel Lachmi Bai, breaks free from the stereotypes of 
cruelty, treachery and sensuality usually associated with the rani 
in the colonial ""Mutiny"" novel. Instead, it goes even beyond 
Taylor's sympathetic scripting of the rani as a deeply wronged 
person and presents her in an idealised manner. As its title 
suggests, it attempts to situate Lakshmibai in the mould ofjoan 
of Arc, who was associated with driving out the English from her 
land and the suggestion is that the chaste rani will similarly drive 
out the English occupiers of her beloved country. Moreover, it 
gives greater multilayered depth to the trope of the heroic 
virangana that Taylor had used 30 years ago. It enriches the 
concept of the fearless ""woman warrior"" by intermeshing 
various strands drawn from European and Indian traditions 
of the courageous fem ale fighter who resists evil and oppression. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we saw in this paper how the image of the rani 
of Jhansi was etched diversely in colonial literary discourse in

inscribed the historical figure of the rebel queen variously. A 
scrutiny of four novels threw up fascinating features. The 
majority of the novels represented Lakshmibai within colonial 
race, class and gender stereotypes. They figured her as cruel 
and licentious and circulated colonial stereotypes about the
274 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week91 
""Mutiny"" in order to disseminate ""colonial knowledge"" about 
the events of 1857 as well as the rani's role in it. However, there 
were two unusual novels which were written right at the 
beginning and the end of this period which presented her with 
sympathy and admiration. Both of these texts, Philip Meadows 
Taylor's famous novel Seeta (1872) and the lesser-known Lachmi 
Bai, Rani of Jhansi (1901) by Michael White, drew upon the 
paradigm of the virangana or warrior-woman, and indeed, the 
latter novel which appeared at the turn of the century went 
further and projected her as a patriotic and fearless freedom 
fighter in a manner that fed into Indian nationalist iconography. NOTES

1857 continues to have a mesmeric hold over the Indian imagina­

mutiny"", ""civil rebellion"", ""rural insurgency having an elitist char­
acter"", ""feudal reaction"", ""national war"" and so on. 1 On the 150th 
anniversary of this great event in Indian history, perhaps what 
captures popular imagination most is the link between 1857 and 
nationalism. It has been regarded as a unique moment in India's 
history when the soul of the nation awoke from slumber to oppose 
alien rule. The state memorialisation of 1857 draws on such 
powerful representations. Voices of dissent, however, dispel the 
dream of annexing the events of 1857 to the meta-narrative of 
Indian nationalism. 2 These events, they say, did not represent a 
single resistance/single past of one people. The story was of many 
pasts. In these pasts, ideological strands implicating diverse notions 
of identity and nationhood remained embedded. Expressions of 
the latter varied considerably across regions and temporal frames. This paper focuses on one set of expressions and ideas by finding 
out what happened in Bengal during this period. I

nationhood/identity on the other have been sought by historians 
and nationalist leaders across the world, at different phases of 
history. More often, such linkages and connections are written 
back into the narrative of resistance, which in retrospect be­
comes ""national"", having an inspirational value for later-day 
uprisings. The Mutiny - in other places the Revolt- of 1857 was 
no exception. Though localised in that it did not include all 
regions or segments of people, the Revolt has been written into 
the history of Indian nationalism in a variety of ways. The 
theoretical stance can be related especially to Afro-Asian con­
texts of nationalism, where the ""roots of the modern-educated 
elite and modern-style politics are shallowest"", making it pos­
sible to argue a historical connection between modern political 
activities and traditional resistance movements. One can even

casting the Revolt in a nationalist mould continue to be valorised, 
re-interpreted and grafted into later narratives, glossing internal 
differences and fragmentations in ideological terrains. The 
purpose here is to mediate between the different strands of 
nationalist interpretation and then situate them in a critical and 
comparative analysis vis-a-vis Bengal. The ways in which the 
""national"" element was perceived in the Revolt (by contempo­
rary observers, and later historians) have varied. Contempora­
neous descriptions of the Revolt as ""a national Revolt"" (by 
Marx),4 and Disraeli's famous interrogation as to whether it was 
a mere ""military mutiny"" or a ""national Revolt"" fired the 
imagination of Indians. The strongest expression in this regard 
was Savarkar's early 20th century depiction of the Revolt as ""the 
Indian War of Independence of 1857"", founded on the twin 
principles of 'swadharma' and 'swaraj', aiming to achieve free­
dom through the help of a secret organisation.5 Turning from such extreme positions, I argue through a case 
study of Bengal that the ""national"" element in 1857 had subtler 
and more nuanced reflections. In doing so, I also demonstrate 
how ""national"" had different connotations in the actual Mutiny­ Revolt that flared in north and central India (the ""mentality of 
the mutiny"" in a general, pan-Indian sense), and in more muted

war waged for the protection of 'deen' (realm) and 'dharma' 
(faith). Though couched in a religious idiom, the remarkable 
point was that this battle against the 'kafir' (the infidel English) 
acquired a ""national"" character because it united the Hindus 
and Muslims through allegiance to the country, and participa­
tion in a common struggle. 7 The use of religion as an idiom was 
underlined in earlier accounts too. Construing the Revolt as a 
social revolution that was the ""source-spring of our national 
movement"", P C Joshi argued that the threat of conversion 
helped promote unity of feeling along religious lines.8 While 
Joshi emphasised the religious factor from the angle of conver­
sion, and Ray underlined it in conjunction with Hindu-Muslim 
unity and attachment to land (Hindustan), Nandalal Chatterjee 
argued that the remarkable unity between Hindus and 
Muslims sustained this patriotic war containing seeds of political 
nationalism. 9 This essay approaches the ""national"" question from a slightly 
different angle, assessing how in the Bengali literati's discourse, 10 
expressions of ""national"" during 1857 and in the following 
period, came to be woven around the conceptual category of 
'samaj' (social collectivity). 11 By focusing on the literati's 
deployment of samaj, I argue that though actual protest was 
muted, and armed opposition absent, the events and ideologies 
of 1857 influenced patterns and trajectories of response that 
could also be fitted into a ""national"" paradigm. The 
emphasis here is on the intertwining of ideas of nationhood and 
samaj in the wake of 1857, and in explaining how ideas about 
history of place, memorialisation and attachment to land, Hindu­
Muslim unity, and crucially, patterns of conduct (a major 
criterion for inclusion in a wider samaj/a pan-Indian social 
universe) - were refracted and redefined through this 
conceptual conjunction. 282

use of labels -""loyalist"" j""rebel"" (in an implicit sense) dates back 
to British approaches to the Revolt as early as May 1857, and 
increased after its suppression when they were anxious to 
distinguish friend from foe. In May 1857, the Bengal Hurkaru 
implicitly distinguished between ""traitor"" and ""loyalist"": ""We 
judge by private letters received from the Northwest and from 
the people ... the disaffection existing amongst the native troops 
seems to have spread far and wide ... the British Government is 
powerful enough to put down traitors by a strong hand.""12 
Problems of simplistic demarcation of""loyalist""/""rebel"" were 
apparent even in so-called ""loyalist"" areas such as Bengal. The 
""loyalism"" of the Bengali intelligentsia contained an internal 
dilemma. Though the western-educated middle classes re­
mained aloof, and even condemned the sepoys, professing 
loyalty to the British because of their ""material interests in the 
new order, and their ideological commitment to new ideas, ""13 
the polarisation of ""loyalist""/""rebel"" needs to be reviewed and 
qualified. As EI Brodkin has pointed out: "" ... while in some 
instances this terminology can serve a useful purpose, perhaps 
more often than not the simplistic categorisation of the Indian 
actors in the drama as loyal or rebel serves mainly to confuse. ""14 
The Revolt of 1857 was not a simple movement but a complex one. As said, its emotional and ideological ramifications and reactions 
varied across regions. Within regions too, there were internal shifts 
and variations. Even among the so-called ""collaborators"" there was 
no uncritical or unconditional acceptance of colonial rule. The 
Calcutta intelligentsia felt what the Hindoo Patriot described as 
""grievances inseparable from subjection to foreign rule.""15 Their 
loyalism sprang more from the head than the heart. H, Even ""loyalists""

The Sepoy Revolt did not take place only in Bareilly. The fire of 
rebellion spread to different places in India - Bengal, Bihar, the North
1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in Bengal 283 
West, Ayodhya, Lucknow, Punjab and Central India. Everywhere, in 
the same way, at the same time, everyone voiced a common demand: 
""We do not want the British, destroy the British rajya [realm], whenever 
you see an Englishman, kill him."" 17 
Though Durgadas is perhaps wrong in saying that people 
in different places including ""loyalist"" areas such as Bengal and 
Punjab voiced their discontent in the same way, what is signi­
ficant here is that a common feeling of discontent pervaded 
India. Its expressions were different - armed rebellion, veiled 
criticism, dilemmas within loyalism, and contradictory strands 
in the same personality. 18 
What is remarkable is that the literati were aware of the 
loyalist dilemma/ambivalence and its cause. Such awareness 
continued well into the associational phase of politics in Bengal, 
and was expressed succinctly in 1878: ""This meeting [at the 
Town Hall of Calcutta] has furnished sufficient materials for 
coming to the conclusion that Bengalis can be loyal to the 
backbone but at the same time they can defend the rights and 
privileges ... in a firm ... way.""19 It is clear that they did not 
consider such loyalty as an impediment to the defence of rights 
and privileges. Rather, the discontent that lay at the heart of the 
loyalist dilemma was regarded as a harbinger of improvement 
and progress: a spur to quests for an empowered identity. Whatever of moral or material progress India has been able to achieve 
under the British rule has been owing to discontent, itself the result of 
advanced thought and cultivated feeling. A nation, like an 
individual...acquires a sense of its duties only in experiencing adver­
sity. Moments of sorrow ... are the most precious moments of individual 
as well as national life. 20 
1857 was such a moment of adversity. It represented the 
culmination of a long process of subjugation and consequent 
unrest. As the impact of that subjugation, and of British rule in 
general, was differential (uneven over different regions), so 
reactions also varied. But they stemmed from a common

1857 was such a moment of adversity. It represented the 
culmination of a long process of subjugation and consequent 
unrest. As the impact of that subjugation, and of British rule in 
general, was differential (uneven over different regions), so 
reactions also varied. But they stemmed from a common 
discontent. Contemporaries in Bengal (in 1857) viewed the 
armed rebellion in north and central India and the situation in 
Bengal as two expressive facets and results of the same discon­
tent. The forms were different, but connected by the ideological 
thread of an oppositional mentality. Opposition need not
284

always be overt or armed: in Bengal, anti-British feeling found 
expression in a critical stance manifested in moves toward 
redefinitions of identity. 21 
While actual participation in the Revolt did not occur, 1857 
acted as a catalyst/turning-point that helped earlier ideas about 
identity acquire new resonances. The two arenas: the events, 
antagonisms and mentalities of the Revolt that swept north and 
central India on the one hand, and reactions in Bengal on the 
other were interpenetrative domains because - (i) they 
expressed reactions that stemmed from a feeling of discontent; 
(ii) the events, ideologies and spirit of the Revolt influenced 
ideas about identity in Bengal. Before analysing the specific 
ways in which ideas about identity acquired new resonances 
from the spirit of 1857, I explore why and how the reaction to 
discontent was different in Bengal. III 
1857: A LINK IN A CHAIN OF SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION In Bengal, the perception of discontent/adversity led to a 
heightened social awareness and an urge for recasting self­
identity. Ideas about the improvement and progress of samaj 
became the means of redefining and articulating the nationalist 
imagination by an intelligentsia torn by conflicting feelings of 
loyalty to the British on the one hand, and a deep and burning 
need for self-expression on the other. Viewed from this angle, 
the present essay is a meaningful intervention aiming to show 
how nationality enmeshed with 'samajik' identities and notions 
of progress in the wake of 1857, and followed a unique trajectory

the present essay is a meaningful intervention aiming to show 
how nationality enmeshed with 'samajik' identities and notions 
of progress in the wake of 1857, and followed a unique trajectory 
that did not clash with loyalist positions defined contextually. By the turn of the century, 1857 (in retrospect) had become a

Bill Controversy (1883) led to a rethinking of the relationship 
between the ruler and the ruled. In the changed socio-cultural 
climate, 1857 acquired a new significance and was part of a 
socially-transformative chain. As Shibnath Shastri remarked: 
The period from 1856-1861 can be termed as a 'mohendrakhhon' 
[momentous phase of many opportunities and changes]. During this
1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in Bengal 285 
phase, widow remarriage agitation, the Indian Mutiny, Indigo Revolt, 
the emergence of Harish Chandra Mukherjee, the publication of 
Som Prakash ... the emergence of Michael Madhusudan in the literary 
scene, Keshabchandra's entry into the Brahma Samaj - all infused 
new life into society, and energised and deeply impacted the Bengali 
samaj. Therefore, it is important to study in detail, the history of each 
of these. 22 The idea also found expression in Ajitkumar Chakrabarty's 
biography of Maharshi Debendranath Tagore. The Revolt of 
1857 sparked off a new phase in the socio-political history of 
Bengal: ""When Debendranath descended from the Himalayas, 
the Sepoy Mutiny was going on. The fire of the Revolt died 
down, but it sowed a new seed in the soil of Bengal... the 
beginning of this new phase can be regarded as an outcome of 
the conflagration of 1857.""23 
1857 opened up a space for the reconfiguration of nation, 
people and land. It speeded a search for identity that enmeshed 
with, and complemented efforts at 'jatiya' uplift through self­
help (an idea present since 1839 in the deliberations of the 
Tattvabodhini Sabha) and the forging ofunities between Bengalis 
and other Indians (concretely expressed in the Hindu Mela's 
agenda). This signified social progress, which was a composite 
idea and movement (as seen in Shibnath's links) containing 
many interactive currents. The orientation was different from 
that of the rebels of north and central India for it did not look 
back to a shattered past even while seeking to establish a new 
order. It recreated the past in the image of the present and the 
future. In fact, the notion of a nation was produced through a 
complex interaction between re-orientations of past unities and 
the circumstances of the modern (late colonial) period.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=335

to the absence of reliable sources, there was a turn toward a 
history of culture and attachment ('samajik itihas'), which could 
provide an imaginative unity to the past and bring the collective 
self into existence. The concern here is to show, how 1857 
speeded and helped recast ideas about samajik history 
entwining with nationhood. 286

1857 IN HISTORY: AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENT History and identity were inextricably intertwined in the 
Bengali imagination, and gathered momentum especially through 
a quest for a ""new"" history that could effectively challenge 
colonial allegations of being a history-less people. 25The literati 
situated the Mutiny-Rebellion in history both as an un­
precedented event, and as a link in a wider, socially-transforma­
tive process. History and identity being closely interlinked, the 
location of 1857 in history may be said to reflect the glimmerings 
of nationhood, rooted in the past. 26 The events and spirit of 1857 
were oriented to a wider agenda of recasting identity through a 
""new"" samajik history, which gathered momentum from the 
cultural-nationalism of the Hindu Mela (1867), and was articu­
lated powerfully in Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay's classic 
essays in the Bangadarshan (during the 1880s). Rajanikanta Gupta, even while professing loyalty to the British 
emphasised the cataclysmic nature of the Revolt, regarding it as an 
unprecedented event in history and comparing it to past struggles: Since the fateful day when the unlucky Siraj-ud-daula was defeated due 
to the conspiracy of the enemy, and the authority of the British 
Company was established in Bengal through the cunning of Lord 
Clive ... , there has been no such violent and cataclysmic occurrence as 
the Revolt. Never has the foundation of colonial authority been shaken

witnessed at every moment the manifestation of such violent power.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=336

wild conflagration. 27 
Rajanikanta situated 1857 within a historical frame of popular 
memory and past glory. The story of how the sepoys attacked 
Delhi was part of a wider description of a historic Delhi - a Delhi 
of past glory eternalised in popular memory. Through a fascinat­
ing oscillation between the past and the present, Rajanikanta, 
related the struggles of 1857 to past glory and instances of 
valour. The ancient history of Delhi is a fascinating tale of many events. Even 
now, the remembrance of this wonderful past lingers in popular 
imagination and memory. Delhi was the favourite residence of the hero 
Prithviraj, the pleasure-arena of the illustrious Mughal emperor Akbar,
1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in Bengal 287 
however, during the 50 years preceding the outbreak of the Sepoy 
Mutiny, the Mughal emperor lost his power and possessions and came 
under the sway of the British Company. But the glory of his name, 
family, prestige and authority has not entirely faded. The power, glory 
and the wide realms of Akbar, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb were 
redrawn in the canvas of popular memory in 1857.28 The past was thus an inspiration for the present and also for the 
future. Harishchandra Mukherjee believed ""history would see and 
evaluate the great Indian Revolt in a manner wholly different from 
how contemporaries in 1857-1858 viewed it.""2'1 This belief was

as to last for generations to come.30 
From this centrality of situating 1857 in history emanate 
several associated themes as enunciated below. V 
HISTORY OF PLACE AND 
MEMORIALISA TION OF HOMELANDS The ""new"" history of culture and attachment gathered mo­
mentum in the wake of the Revolt, and engaged with a history­
led refinement of place and the land. 1857 was crucial in this 
regard in three main ways - (i) connection of place to its history; 
(ii) connection of place to the people; and (iii) a complex 
concatenation of people, place/land and conduct, reflected in 
juxtapositions of Bengal to specific places within India. Specific places in north and central India where battle raged 
between the sepoys and the British were situated in a historical 
grid. As expressed by Rajanikanta Gupta: 
1000 miles from Calcutta, surrounded by hills - is Ambala, the ancient 
name of which is Ambalya. The history of this place goes back to the 
Pandava age. In ancient India Ambala was a place of glory, as it
288 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
corresponded to Kurukshetra of epic fame, the site of eternal valour. This is also the place where Prithviraj and Samarsingha were defeated, 
signalling the beginning of dark days ... in the ancient history of India, 
Ambala was well-known even at a time when Europe was savage ... 
now, after many years, Ambala has become the site of conflict between 
the sepoys and the East India Company.31 The above description connects place and its geographical 
location to a history of glory and its eclipse. The lament for lost 
glory is expressed in a yearning to retreat through a nostalgic 
journey, to past triumphs. The yearning was also felt by Bengali 
writers who were in Delhi at the time of the Revolt.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=338

location to a history of glory and its eclipse. The lament for lost 
glory is expressed in a yearning to retreat through a nostalgic 
journey, to past triumphs. The yearning was also felt by Bengali 
writers who were in Delhi at the time of the Revolt. J adunath 
Sarbadhikary, who toured India from 1853 to 1857, connected 
Delhi to its past, glorifying it as the seat of the Emperor, and 
memorialising it as a site of Hindu glory exemplified in the 
valour and prowess of Prithvira('2 Like Rajanikanta, J adunath 
reified places of corn bat ( during 1857) through mythic/epic glory 
intersecting with history: To the north-west of Kanpur, about 8 kros away is Bithoor. This corre­
sponds to the forest abode of V almiki. This is where Sita spent the years 
of her banishment and where Lav and Kush were born. Now ... here stands 
a house of Baji Rao of Pune and Satara. Some soldiers occupy the place 
and it is the home of Nana Saheb, Baji Rao's descendant. 33 
1857 was crucial in such historicisations of place and transfor­
mations of space to place, by endowing empty space with an 
emotive content. The history of place became an emotionally­
charged ideological site of valour, leading to the memorialisation 
of homelands. What happened in 1857 in certain places, and 
local homelands were related to what had happened there 
earlier, connecting past instances of valour, glory and commit­
ment to ideals of courage and independence to similar roles of 
present exemplars. This bonded place to the people and their 
past, who could then lay a claim to such valiant histories. The land of the Marathas had long symbolised independence, courage 
and strength. Shivaji had shown immortal valour in battle ... the people 
of Maharashtra, infused with the magic of his great mantra, left the 
imprint of their courage in every part of the country from Dakshinapatha 
to Aryavarta. This inspired Nana Saheb to great acts of courage, and 
he carried on the legacy of his lineage. To bow down before oppressors 
is not the mark of a courageous man. Nana Saheb did not... slide down 
from the high ideal of moral courage set by his forefathers. He

be lauded by history. M 
Connections of people to place and to their past were further 
refined by emphasising an additional factor: conduct.] adunath's 
travel account demonstrated how the complex interconnections 
of place-history, place-people, people-conduct and unity among 
the people of specific places were reflected in mental configura­
tions of region-nation. There are many Bengali babus of good character with marked qualities 
of generosity in Ambala. They generally congregate around the 
Kalibari [the temple of the goddess Kali] ... the inhabitants of Delhi are 
well-spoken, of good character; they are committed to duty and to 
righteousness or dharma ... Before evening, all jatis [including Hindus 
and Muslims, and people oflow classes] congregate in different parts 
of the city. 15 
Bengal, Ambala and Delhi were linked to each other, and inter­
locked with notions of jati and conduct that underlay a 
deeper sense of belonging to a wider entity. The idea that 
Jadunath's account was a pilgrim narrative, of the same type as 
the late 18th century Tirthamangal of Bijoyram Sen, in which 
there was no conception of the historical-national entity called 
India, is to miss the finer nuances of the work. Though different 
from late 19th century tracts on travel, it cannot be clubbed 
simplistically with the earlier pilgrim narratives. Jadunath's 
descriptions of pilgrim sites were linked to ideas about 'desh' 
(country) and the samaj.36 It awakened a living sense of the 
samajs, local everyday life, customs and manners, conduct, 
histories and 'itikatha' (account of the past). 37This constituted 
the prelude to late-nineteenth and early 20th century travel 
writing and historical accounts which sought to reinforce the 
belief in Indian nationhood rooted in history. As Dharanikanta 
Lahiri Choudhury put it - the best way to understand the past 
and present of the Indian nation was to see historical places and 
observe the customs of specific places in India.38 
Through such connections between place, people, conduct, 
and specifically between the people and regions of different 
parts of the country,Jadunath's account anticipated the idea of 
India, otherwise called BharatbarshajHindustan.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=340

290 
7 857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
India went through intermediate phases, andjadunath may be 
said to represent a transitional genre. The quest for a history of 
place during and after 1857 reflected a mental transition from 
mythic to real India, perceived and actualised through history, 
myth and juxtapositions of region to country. The juxtapositions 
occurred in myriad ways. References to specific places (signi­
ficant as sites of rebellion during 1857-58) related myth to 
sociological actualities in attempts to link Bengal and Bengalis 
to other parts of India as part of a wider samajik history. Jadunath eloquently captured this interconnection: 
Kanpur is closely connected to Kanyakubja. This place is of great 
significance to Bengalis in past and present contexts. Six kros away 
from Bithoor is Kanyakubja. Here dwell the Kanauj brahmans ... From 
Kanyakubja came five brahmans and kayasthas to Bengal. We are also 
among them. !We are their descendants).39 
1857 helped redefine and reify India and places within it 
through a use of the past (common historical experience), as 
seen in Rajanikanta, as well as through a concatenation of 
people, place, land, conduct and sociological interconnections 
reflected injadunath's ideas. VI 
THE IDEA OF INDIA The reification of place through history etched the conceptual 
outlines of India/Hindustan/Bharat. Though the idea of a his­
toric-geographic entity called India crystallised only towards the 
end of the 19th century, the late 1850s witnessed its glimmerings. As mentioned, the idea of India moved through many connota­
tive frames - mythic, historical-geographic, territorial and politi­
cal (the last crystallising through the national movement of the 
late-19th and the 20th century). The Revolt may be seen as a 
turning-point in the evolution of the idea of India. This is 
because India was imagined through history, and 1857 was a 
watershed in India's history.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=341

turning-point in the evolution of the idea of India. This is 
because India was imagined through history, and 1857 was a 
watershed in India's history. It marked a definite stage in the 
conceptualisation of India variously termed as 'swadesh', 
'matribhoomi', 'janmabhoomi' and Bharatbarsha. History of 
place was linked to the agenda of imagining India, as the fate/ 
misfortune of specific places during the Revolt was regarded as 
a betrayal of the whole country. Kasiprosad Ghosh lamented
1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in Bengal 291 
that the annexation and misfortune of Oudh symbolised a loss 
of the country's liberty and independence.40 The Revolt was also contextualised with reference to the idea 
of an Aryan India which became a leitmotif in most Bengali texts 
on history from the mid-1870s. It idealised the land/country as 
a heroic site of valour (usually defined in Aryan terms). 41 
Locating the theme of Aryan India in a temporal spiral of past 
glory and present decline, Rajanikanta argued that glorious eras 
waned when the ideals of Aryan courage and dharma were 
eclipsed. India was situated in a dominance-subjugation histori­
cal frame of which the Revolt was an integral part. The ""descen­
dants of those who were once renowned for their courage (such 
as Prithviraj, Samar and Pratap Singh} came under the yoke of 
domination"". 42 They did not possess the Aryan qualities of 
courage and righteousness. With the revival of those ideals, 
glory would return. Shivaji had revived the golden age as he 
personified the Aryan ideals of courage and valour. 43 Signifi­
cantly, such courage was also exemplified in the acts and deeds 
of rebel leaders during 1857-58. Lakshmibai was the truly courageous woman of 19th century India. When India was in the grip of imperial rule from the Himalayas to 
Kumarika ... she challenged the British, and displaying superhuman 
courage ... fought against great adversity ... At the time of the Sepoy War 
in 1857, when Bharatbarsha was in the throes of a major upheaval, 
Bundelkhand was also caught up in turmoil like Kanpur, Meerut, 
Lucknow and Delhi. At that time, the brave Rani Lakshmibai strove to 
revive her lost pride. 44 The above account apprehended the historic-geographic 
entity called India through Aryan ideals of moral courage and 
righteous conduct as exemplified in the Revolt of 1857.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=342

nationhood through a religious idiom that connected people to 
swadesh. This occurred through a twin deification of heroes and 
the homeland. ""His countrymen (swadeshigon} regarded Shivaji 
as an incarnation of God (avatar). He named his sword 'Bhavani'. This sword is now in the possession of the King of Satara, and 
until today in the royal household at Satara, Bhavani is wor• 
shipped.""45 The ideals of independence and 'swarajya' (own 
realm) were personified in Bharat'sjlndia's all-powerful goddess 
of endeavour and victory. 46 The deification of the country was
292 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
a fairly common theme in Bengal during the late 19th century, 
and occurred in different, (especially Hindu) contexts.47 The 
notion of nation as mother was deeply embedded in post­ Mutiny historical works and travel accounts contemporaneous 
to the Revolt (such as that of Jadunath Sarbadhikary, whose 
Tirthabhraman was serialised in janmabhoomijLand of Birth). Crucially, the Revolt of 1857 helped connect earlier ideas 
about India (pre-1857) to India in 1857 and in the following 
years. In the Bengali literati's ideas about the role of 1857 in 
transforming ideas about India through history of place, valour, 
and deification, the narrative moved backward to deification of 
specific places such as Maharashtra (the home of a 'mahajati'/ 
great jati) and then connected Kanpur and Satara ( during the 
Revolt) to this historical chain. There was also an attempt to link 
and compare pre-1857 India to such imaginings. The accounts 
often swung back to Plassey, when Aryan ideals of courage, 
dharma and justice were trampled and insulted by the British 
and disregarded by the conspirators who sided with them. 48This 
phase saw the defeat of the ideal Bharatbarsha of ancient times, 
and was also very different from India in 1857. In a sense 1857 
corresponded to the ancient ideal India because the qualities of 
courage and dharma surfaced in the acts and deeds of the 
leaders. The account of a supposed ""loyalist"" (Rajanianata) 
glorifying 1857 as an exemplary phase in recreating an ideal 
India, is significant, and adds a new dimension to understand­
ings of nationhood in Bengal. Two points are important.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=343

glorifying 1857 as an exemplary phase in recreating an ideal

ings of nationhood in Bengal. Two points are important. First, 
there was a connectivity in imaginings about India, reflected in 
the use and contextualisation of the term ""Bharatbarsha"" in 
bygone (days of Hindu glory), pre-Plassey and Plassey, as well 
as present (1857) times. Second, 1857 was a watershed not only 
in the recreation of a glorious India, but also in taking the 
country onwards toward new ideals of unity. The multiple portrayals in terms of deification through a 
religious idiom, Aryan culture, history and progress that came 
in the wake of 1857 included, but moved beyond the concepts 
of mythic Bharat (the country of the sons of the King Bharat of 
the Mahabharata), and territorial Hindustan (which existed 
from the period of the Turkish Sultans through the Mughal and 
up to the modern period despite semantic shifts), and prioritised 
a higher and wider entity expressed through the descriptive
1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in Bengal 293 
term: Bharatbarsha. In fact, the earlier senses of India as mythic 
Bharat and territorial Hindustan blended and fused into 
Bharatbarsha through a unique interlocking of history and 
nationhood. The linkages and connotative continuities made 
the 'puranic' Bharat and medieval Hindustan very much a part 
of the nationalist imaginaire.49Bharatbarsha was the India of the 
past, a heroic and historical India, and the homeland of the 
people. It included Hindustan, which signified north India and 
the different places where the mutineers fought with the British. Travel to these places helped juxtapose Bengalis to other 
Indians (including Hindustanis).50 In conjunction with an urge 
for regional and sub-regional histories of Bengal51 seen as 
emblematic of a people's past, it forged meaningful linkages 
between the region and the nation. The inclusive and incorpo­
rating character of samaj explained the link between regional 
(Bengali) and Bharatbarshiya samajs. Adherence to a ""proper"" 
code of conduct implying qualities such as truthfulness, moral 
courage, generosity and righteousness was the chief criteria for 
inclusion. 52 These qualities were deemed to be ""Aryan"" and 
were exemplified in the acts and deeds of the rebel leaders 
during the Revolt. This helped construct an inclusive

345,"Adherence to a ""proper"" 
code of conduct implying qualities such as truthfulness, moral 
courage, generosity and righteousness was the chief criteria for 
inclusion. 52 These qualities were deemed to be ""Aryan"" and 
were exemplified in the acts and deeds of the rebel leaders 
during the Revolt. This helped construct an inclusive 
Bharatbarshiya universe, albeit in high Hindu/Aryan terms. Most significantly, to the literati, Bharatbarsha was the India 
of the future, because it contained within it, ideas about samaj 
and progress. The link between samaj, nation and progress was 
underscored in travel accounts, historical tracts, articles in 
periodicals and private papers during and after the Revolt. Shambhu Chandra-Mukherjee, Bankimchandra Chattopadhayay 
and Bholanath Chunder - in various articles, correspondence 
and tracts - connected the country and the samaj to the nation, 
and both to the common aim of progress:53 
VII 
FACETS OF PATRIOTISM The idea of India expressed as Bharatbarsha was based on the 
connection of the land and the people. But whose Bharatbarsha 
was being talked about/imagined? The basic issue of Indian-ness 
was fraught with divisions at various levels - (i) social strata/ 
class, (ii) caste, and (iii) community. The western-educated
294 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
Bengali literati, writing travel-accounts and historical tracts 
during and after 1857 were keenly sensitive to how other Indians 
perceived them. Juxtapositions of Bengaljlndia and Bengalis/ 
other Indians were shot through with the internal fragmenta­
tions mentioned above. While the Bengali literati travelling in 
parts of north and central India during the late 1850s could 
relate (at one level) to their educated/cultured counterparts 
from other parts of India, differences and antagonisms re­
mained. Ordinary people of north and west India vilified and 
attacked Bengalis whom they regarded as agents/collaborators 
of the British during the Revolt. The twin facets of this otherness 
- the uncivilised and superstitious sepoy ""traitor"" and the 
western-educated, Anglicised Bengali babu (loyalist) found 
expression in many tracts. 54 The crucial point here is how such 
divisions and fragmentations influenced the imagining of self­
other relations. How far was 1857 an ideological rallying-point 
for reconsidering unities despite fragmentations? What were the 
contexts of assimilation? In other words, was it possible to move 
from fragments to an overarching Indian samaj (idea of nation­
hood)? The present section problematises the issue of patriotism 
in Bengal with reference to Hindu-Muslim unity/difference. In 
this connection I also compare the Bengali formulations of 
patriotism and representations of unity to the ""mentality of the 
mutiny"" in an all-India sense.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=345
346,"What were the 
contexts of assimilation? In other words, was it possible to move 
from fragments to an overarching Indian samaj (idea of nation­
hood)? The present section problematises the issue of patriotism 
in Bengal with reference to Hindu-Muslim unity/difference. In 
this connection I also compare the Bengali formulations of 
patriotism and representations of unity to the ""mentality of the 
mutiny"" in an all-India sense. Rajat Kanta Ray has argued that 
two main factors united the Hindus and Muslims during the 
Revolt: their opposition to the alien kafirs (British) and their 
attachment to the country. They wished to bring back the old 
social order based on difference, but mutual coexistence of the 
two communities. This forged the inchoate social nationality: 
""the Hindus and Musalmans of Hindustan"", overlaid by the 
W eltanschauung of religion. 55 
The idea was echoed in specific ways in the Bengali literati's 
works relating to the Revolt. Rajanikanta Gupta noted the 
degree of unity between Hindus and Muslims and considered 
the two communities to be an integral part of Bharatbarsha. The 
two factors mentioned by Ray - opposition to the British and 
attachment to the country underlay Rajanikanta's ideas too: 
""From April 1857 the Governor General understood that those 
very Indians who had once helped the British to strengthen 
themselves ... had turned against them. The Hindus and
1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in Bengal 295 
Musalmans of Bharatbarsha were united in their endeavour to 
harm the British. ""56 What is significant is that Rajanikanta used 
the term ""Bharatbarsha"" instead of ""Hindustan"" in describing 
the attachment of the united group ""Hindus and Musalmans"" to 
the country. This added a new dimension to the idea of 
nationhood, which was further strengthened by linking the 
history of place, jati and dharma to the issue of Hindu-Muslim 
unity: ""Ambala was the place of unity ... of Hindus and 
Muslims ... who dreamed of equality .. .it became a site of war 
where the pride of jati and the purity of dharma were trampled. ""5i 
Similarly, Delhi was regarded as a historical site where the 
pride and self-respect of Hindus and Muslims had been once 
celebrated. 58 
Even conservative writers such as Panchkori Bandyopadhyay, 
deeply rooted in an Aryan/Hindu inherited tradition, emphasised 
Hindu-Muslim unity. Despite being separate units for so long, 
after Dalhousie's annexations, the ""Bharatbarshiya"" Hindus and 
Muslims rose in Revolt. 59 This account, like Rajanikanta's, 
forged the social collectivity: Hindus and Muslims of 
Bharatbarsha.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=346

forged the social collectivity: Hindus and Muslims of 
Bharatbarsha. Other works which regarded the Revolt as a 
mere sepoy mutiny also admitted the unity of Hindus and 
Muslims.60 
Such assertions of Hindu-Muslim unity in accounts of the 
Revolt anticipated certain aspects of a slightly later (1880s and 
1890s) and wider discourse on a joint Indo-Islamic historical 
legacy. Although the leitmotif of an Aryan-Hindu India led to a 
general denigration of Muslim culture and history reflected in 
familiar cliches of ""Muslim misrule""j""medieval tyranny"", some 
voices stressed plurality, and sought to incorporate Muslims on 
Hindu terms. The flexibility of ""culturally Aryan"" afforded 
scope for including others (including Muslims) who adhered to 
a ""proper"" code of conduct/1 muting the polarity of ""Hindu"" 
and ""non-Hindu"" in a discourse that was in continual flux. Akshoykumar Moitreya underlined a joint Indo-lslamic histori­
cal legacy of pre-colonial Bengal62 when Hindus and Muslims 
formed a common ruling elite. These perspectives were re­
flected in, and contextualised with reference to ideas about 
Hindu-Muslim unity during the Revolt of 1857. Rajanikanta 
recounted how Hindu-Muslim cooperation during the Mughal 
period had signified a common glory. The eclipse of this glory

by the rise of the British and their victories during the Revolt had 
spelt doom for both communities: During the Mughal period, Hindus and Muslims were engaged alike 
in political and military duties. The Hindus gave good advice to the 
Mughals in political matters, and were chieftains of Mughal-occupied 
provinces. Their power and pride were based on their sense of duty, 
devotion to values and good conduct. .. [NowJ their sons realised that

remembered alike by the Hindu senapatis, rajasva mantris and

Such portrayals do not fit the mould of Muslim tyranny/ 
misrule. The events of 1857 helped recast and occasionally even 
break such stereotypes. 64 However, the theme of Hindu-Muslim 
unity during the Revolt (underlying the ""mentality of the 
mutiny"" in an all-India sense) was subtly transmuted in the 
Bengali literati's discourse. While unity was highlighted (as seen 
above) in certain contexts, there were limitations in Bengali 
conceptualisations of an all-India patriotism based on Hindu­
Muslim unity. An on-the-spot autobiographical account, Bidrohe 
Bangali pointed out that Hindus and the ordinary people of 
Rohilkhand were not elated at the re-establishment of the 
Nawab's (Muslim) rule.65 In fiction too, the stereotypes of the 
""good"" Hindu and the ""bad"" Muslim persisted.66 lt is important 
to note that such portrayals were characteristic of overtly loyalist 
accounts. Durgadas Bandyopadhay, the author of Bidrohe Bangali 
actually fought on the British side against the sepoys, and 
Chittabinodini, the anti-Muslim fictional work was markedly 
loyalist in tone. Such viewpoints expressed convictions of the 
beneficence of British rule, viewing a ""tyrannical"" medieval as 
a dark foil offsetting modernity. From the 1870s various works equated ""Aryan"" with ""Hindu"", 
and linked Bengalis to a heroic Aryan identity. However, all 
works glorifying Aryanism did not exclude and denigrate (in all 
contexts) the Muslim ""other"". As mentioned earlier, cultural 
Aryanism, linked to the inclusive concept of samaj left room for 
assimilation. What is significant is that the same individual could 
stress both Aryan glory and Hindu-Muslim unity in different 
contexts. Rajanikanta, who glorified Aryan achievements in
1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in Bengal 297 
Arya Kirti (1896) highlighted Hindu-Muslim unity in the context 
of the Revolt of 1857. The inclusive theme was definitely a major 
trajectory in conceptualisations of patriotism in Bengal during 
and after 1857. Just as in north India, the idea of the 'qaum' 
was applied in the context of Hindus too, 68 in Bengal samaj 
was deployed as an inclusive conceptual category that could 
contextually include ""others"" including Muslims. CONCLUSION The conceptual conjunction of the themes explored in this

article illuminates hitherto understated aspects of the Bengali 
literati's ideas about nationhood as they came to be developed 
around 1857. It has drawn on contemporaneous on-the spot 
accounts, but more on the tracts and articles (related to 1857) 
which proliferated within about 17 years of the Revolt, and 
assessed how the changing socio-cultural milieu and historical 
circumstances shaped the ideological contours of the 
discourse. The latter represents one trajectory of response, 
and does not imply the denial of other discourses. It portrays the 
ideas of one section of the Bengali society: the western-edu­
cated, mainly high-caste, professional literati. Within this social 
segment too, there were internal variations, but this essay has 
tried to map areas of consensus and ideological rendezvous 
despite internal shifts. The uniqueness of the Bengali (regional) representation of an 
iconic ""national"" event lay in the situation of 1857 within a wider 
discourse on nationhood by deploying the conceptual category 
of samaj. The specific ways in which 1857 figured in the Bengali 
nationalist imaginaire flowed from samaj, which implied both 
being and becoming a nation, and related past, indigenous to 
modern (19th century) unities. As inheritances were important 
to such grounding of nationhood, the location of 1857 in history 
was crucial. The elements of nationhood embedded in the (all­
India) ""mentality of the mutiny"" were subtly transmuted. The 
urge for progress emphasised the inculcation of a ""proper"" code 
of conduct and self-improvement, which found expression in 
cultural nationalism and the agenda of 'jatipratishtha'. Thus the 
national element in the literati's discourse was couched in a 
samajik and not a religious rhetoric. The theme of social

progress drew on a history of the social collectivity which 
reconfigured place and the country. The utopic and inclusive 
space of the continually incorporating samaj moved beyond 
""Hindustan"" toward ""Bharatbarsha"" thus transcending and

were inherent limitations (such as contextual dilution of the all­
India Hindu-Muslim unity) in such conceptualisations, the

mid-1870s. See, for instance, Gobinda Chandra Ghosh, Chittobinodini; and 
Mitra, Bharater Sukhasapna. 42 Ibid, p 46. See also Rajanikanta's other work, Bharatprasanga, Calcutta, 
1880, reprinted 1887, pp 1-8. 
43 Rajanikanta Gupta, Birmahima, Calcutta, 1885, pp 45-46. 
44 Ibid, pp 25-31. Though the portrayal ofrebel leaders such as the Rani of 
Jhansi or Nana Saheb did not follow a uniform pattern, the trajectory of 
valorisation became dominant from the late 19th century and helped shape 
notions of an Aryan India. See Chandicharan Sen, Jhansir Rani, 1888 and 
Mitra, Nana Saheb.

49 The idea of a 'puranic' geography and the continuity of myth in imagining 
India were present in a number of tracts. See Nagendranath Basu, Banger 
jatiya ltihas, Calcutta, 1900. 1857 and Ideas about Nationhood in Bengal 301 
50 Such juxtapositions are reflected in the use and acceptance of the terms 
'Young Bengal' vis-a-vis 'Young Hindustani'. See Bholanath Chunder, 
Travels of a Hindoo, London, 1869, Vo! 1, pp 388-99; Vol 2, pp 392-94, 
mentioned by Chatterjee, 'Discovering India', p 214. 
51 The urge for regional and sub-regional histories of Bengal was noted in an 
article, 'Itihas Sangraha' in Tattvabodhini Patrika, No 229, Bhadra, 1862, 
printed in Benoy Ghosh, Shamoyikpatre Sekaler Samajchitra, Calcutta, 
1963, p 209. 
52 The literati connected these criteria to cultural Aryanism implying adher­
ence to the epics and the puranas, linguistic connections with Sanskrit and 
belief in a supreme Godhead. See Rajnarain Basu, Bridhha Hindur Asha, 
Calcutta, 1881, and Atmacharit, Calcutta, 1908, p 96. This has been 
mentioned in Indira Chowdhury-Sengupta, 'Colonialism and Cultural 
Identity: The Making of a Hindu Discourse', unpublished PhD thesis, School 
of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, 1993, pp 43-45. 53 See Bholanath Chunder's articles in Mukherjee's Magazine from 1873

Revolt, the Muslims were a qaum (people/race/community/nation), and in 
their eyes the Hindus were too. See Ray, The Felt Community, p 383. The 
interplay between the conceptual categories of qaum and samaj brings to 
light an interesting difference: while qaum signified separateness/differ· 
ence of the Hindus and Muslims, samaj was a more inclusive rubric that 
could weld diverse groups and forge unity within the interstices of clan, 
caste, community and micro-region. 16 
Mangal Pandey: Film and History 
Rochona Majumdar, Dipesh Chakrabarty 
WE begin with an acknowledgement: that what happened in 
British India in 1857 cannot be comprehensively covered by any 
one particular name usually given to it - the Mutiny, the First 
War of Independence, a people's war, a peasant uprising, and 
so on. There were no doubt particular elements in the events that 
partially justify such attempts at classification but we believe that, 
taken as a whole, what happened was no one thing. So after 
the fashion of calling the events of September 11, 2001, simply 
""9/11"", we will call the events of 1857, ""1857"". Precisely because 
1857 was no one specific event and had its impact on many 
different scales, it has been recalled on several different registers 
ever since its occurrence: as memoirs, as traveller's experience, 
as history, as fiction, as photographs, paintings and sketches, and 
as films. Ketan Mehta's film Mangat Pandey (2005, with Aamir 
Khan as Pandey) was one such recent filmic reconstruction of the 
early events of 1857: the rebellion of a lone soldier, Mangal 
Pandey, of the 34th regiment of the Native Infantry of the East 
India Company's army.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=356

early events of 1857: the rebellion of a lone soldier, Mangal 
Pandey, of the 34th regiment of the Native Infantry of the East 
India Company's army. Our point of departure is the fact that the film Mangat Pandey 
(hereafter MP) gave rise to a lively debate in the Indian press 
about historical films and their relationship to actual histories ( as 
historians might write them). This general point about filmic 
rendition of the past and its relation to the past itself - the past 
that historians try to recover -is something that interests us in this 
essay. But there is also a second point of interest. MP was 
something of an exception in stirring up such a controversy 
about history (for more details on the controversy, see below). MP, for instance, was not the first filmic representation of 1857. Two other films that readily come to mind, if we excluded 
Sohrab Merwanji Modi's 1953Jhansi ki Rani, arejunoon (1978,
304 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week0' 
directed by Shyam Benegal) based on Ruskin Bond's ""A Flight 
of Pigeons"" and Shatranj ke Khiladi (1977, directed by Satyajit 
Ray). Both these films were set against the stormy backdrop of 
the political turmoil of 1857. Yet, neither raised the hackles of 
intellectuals, politicians, film critics, and journalists in the way 
that MP did. Indeed, as Priyajaikumar has pointed out in her recent work 
on films in colonial India, historicals as a genre have had a long 
life in Indian cinema. From the colonial period on, Indian films 
in the historical genre depicted imaginary pasts, while mytho­
logicals incorporated stories from the epics and puranas or 
constructed fables to narrate allegorical tales about Indian 
society. But the lack of realism that characterised either genre is 
read by J aikumar as serving a direct political, i e, nationalist or 
anti-colonial purpose during colonial rule. As she argues, 
""Almost in direct defiance ( of the state) Indian historicals repeat­
edly enacted a crisis of authority in governance.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=357

""Almost in direct defiance ( of the state) Indian historicals repeat­
edly enacted a crisis of authority in governance. Historicals were 
different from socials in their placement of a film's dramatic 
action in antiquity; they literally erased the presence of foreign 
colonisers by transposing visions of a future nation onto a 
fantasised past.""' Not that the colonial government was duped 
by this aesthetic sleight of hand. To cite Jaikumar once again, 
""The state gauged sedition based on assessment of intent; novels 
and films were of interest to the state for their submerged 
meanings and for their intentional as well as unintentional 
effects.""2 Despite their departure from tropes of classical realism 
- which in the context of Indian cinema is the aesthetic counter­
part of the politidl project of nation building - the colonial­ Indian historical film can be interpreted as a text that locates the 
""harsh and strange spots of the past"" in an even more distant or 
imaginary past if only to allow the viewer to ""conceive good 
wishes for the future"".3 
Jaikumar's conclusion about the historical in the age of 
Empire has a direct bearing on what we argue in the forthcoming 
pages and is therefore worth dwelling upon at some length. Colonial cinema's realisation of an ideal future society, she 
argues, ""is contingent on an Antigone-like rejection of (the 
potentially authoritarian, unreliable, or corrupt) contemporary 
state/community. The colonial historical most closely fulfils a 
people's romance with the notion of a future Indian nation,
Mangal Pandey: Film and History 305 
imagined as a predestined tryst with one's unrealised but innate, 
antique potential for righteous self govemance.""4 It seems to us, however, that with the attainment of indepen­
dence, historical films lost this political function. They became 
the stuff of mythic lore, stories inserted into the past with no basis 
in either fact or politics. Hence Sharmistha Gooptu's observa­
tion that the 1960 historical drama Mughal-e-Azam which was 
only ""loosely"" historical hardly ever attracted the kind of moral 
and political attention that got focused on MP. 5 Films such as the 
more recent Legend of Bhagat Singh (2002, directed by Rajkumar 
Santoshi), The Making of the Mahatma (1996, directed by Shyam 
Benegal), Sardar (1993, also directed by Ketan Mehta) have all 
modelled themselves on historical research.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=358

about the historicity of these films, or their supposed impact on 
the audience. Yet, with MP, all kinds of anxieties, concerns, and 
strong sentiments were expressed in the press. Thus, to only give 
two examples, a commentator in The Hindu complained: 
Bollywood continues to defile history. Now distorting, now disparag­
ing, Bollywood's arthritic treatment of the past goes on. Ketan Mehta's 
much panned ""Mangal Pandey"" is only the latest ... In the garb of 
artistic licence truth is short-changed, and only an honest cinemagoer 
with a heart for history duped.6 And a comment online read: 
Aamir Khan is a rabble-rouser. It's a role he has mastered to perfec­
tion. His nostrils flare up, eye sockets pop and righteous indignation 
spills across the screen. It's no surprise, then, that it is this Angry Khan 
plastered on all posters for Mangal Pandey: The Rising. Luckily for 
him, as well as his audience, the rabble-rousing works. He did it in 
Lagaan. He does it again here. Only this time around, he's better 
dressed for the occasion.7 Among the many talking points against the film were the 
following: the film was a travesty of ""history"", it was a melodra­
matic spectacle that cost a staggering 500 crores part of which 
came from the UK Film Council, but later vilified the British, that 
it peddled myths and jingoism as history. And perhaps most 
damning of all from the standpoint of the film industry was that 
there was no consensus on whether or not, like Lagaan, MP 
could be considered a box office success. It was not that the criticism was always unfair or untrue. In any 
case, we do not seek to decide that question.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=359

306 
1857: Essays /tom Economic and Political Weekry 
to put forward some speculative and tentative thoughts on why, 
unlike other historicals in the post-independence period, MP 
gave rise to such concerned 
and concerted 
criticism. If we 
bracket for the moment the question of commercial gains -
something that is at the heart of any Bollywood enterprise and 
something that can easily give rise to moral positions 
we will 
proceed to suggest that the concerns about historical accuracy 
that were expressed about and around MP may be read as 
belonging to a tradition of debates what might constitute, 
properly, ""a politics of the people"" in democracies in the age of 
mass-media and mass-politics. Some aspects of this debate are 
global, as we shall see, but certain twists are specifically Indian. THE NARRATIVE OF THE FILM 
MP opens with a song sequence. The picturisation is as 
follows. There is first a dissolving shot of a painting that gives way 
to the sun rising against the horizon of a river, presumably the 
Ganges. As titles roll we witness a group of men on an elephant 
addressing themselves to entire villages, early bathers on the 
river ghats, people congregated at bazaars and under trees, 
munshis, sepoys, traders, urging them all to rise. Their journey 
ends outside what appears to be a jail or barrack and we are 
introduced to one of the main players of the film - the English 
East India Company. The ""rising"" invoked in the song is also 
brought into perspective as we witness red coated British soldiers 
marching in an orderly file into the barracks escorting with them 
a person who is shown from the ground up. His feet are heavily 
shackled, he is chained and handcuffed. As the camera moves 
up his body we see his thickly bandaged torso under which his 
sacred thread is displayed quite prominently. We know at this 
point that the long haired, light skinned prisoner is one of the 
twice-born. As we wait for a frontal shot of the prisoner we are told more 
about the Company.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=360

sacred thread is displayed quite prominently. We know at this 
point that the long haired, light skinned prisoner is one of the 
twice-born. As we wait for a frontal shot of the prisoner we are told more 
about the Company. That it was one of the most powerful 
political and commercial enterprises of the 19th century and by 
1857 it controlled 20 per cent of the world's population. The 
Company, the voiceover tells us, had its own laws, government, 
and army. Once the opposition is clearly identified, the camera 
rolls back to the prisoner who is now being mounted on the
Mangal Pandey: Film and History 307 
gallows. Standing on one side is an orderly group of British 
soldiers, one of whom has discomfiture and pathos written on his 
face. As viewers we do not know at this point that the narrative 
of the film will be based on the remembrance of this lone 
Indophilic Englishman who is later introduced as Captain 
Gordon. But the bruise on his cheek and his overt embarrass­
ment at the sight of the prisoner tells us that within the East India 
Company are whites who feel ill-fitted to the Company's outfit. Finally we get a frontal shot of Mangal Pandey. But our first 
glimpse of him happens through a noose that is about to go 
around his neck. This shot of Pandey's face framed by the noose 
returns us again to the theme of the opening song whose refrain 
'mangala mangala' foretells an event that will be auspicious for 
all. It is almost as if the noose in this case is a garland that is put 
around the neck of a deity that brings all round 'kushal mangal' 
(good luck) - an expression occurring in the song - to worship­
pers and those beholding the deity. The tightening of the noose 
around Mangal Pandey's neck will bring a similar auspicious­
ness to the country where he was born. When asked by the 
presiding British officer whether he has a last wish, Mangal 
Pandey declares that it is beyond the officer's powers to grant 
him his last wishes. But that he is certain that those wishes would 
one day be fulfilled. The hanging cannot be carried out on that day, April 7, 1857, 
as the hangman who was supposed to carry out the task had 
deserted his duty. As the Company sends out for a new hangman 
we enter the film's narrative through a flashback by Captain 
Gordon. The central axis around which the film revolves is the 
friendship between Mangal Pandey and Gordon. The latter is 
constantly separated out from the rest of his fellow officers.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=361

friendship between Mangal Pandey and Gordon. The latter is 
constantly separated out from the rest of his fellow officers. While he is superior in rank to Pandey, he is a man of humble 
origins from Glasgow, a papist among his protestant brethren. He is also more avowedly Indian than he is English having lived 
and worked in India and eventually is shown having a relation­
ship with a Hindu widow,Jwala. It is Gordon who in response 
to a query from Mangal Pandey tells us about the Company. Answering Pandey's repeated questions about ""who is the 
Company?"", ""what is this object called the Company?"" Gordon 
states that the Company is a strange creature ('ajeeb hasti'). It has 
a single motto, profit. This it manages through trade - trade in
308 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
indigo, opium, spices, love, honour, anything and everything in 
the world. He likens the company to the ""villain"" in the Indian 
epic Ramayana. But if Ravana had ten heads, the Company has 
a thousand which are glued together by one overriding drive -
""greed."" On a previous occasion, at a party in the house of his 
senior officer Gordon tells Emily Kent, the host's daughter that 
the Company forces Indian peasants to cultivate poppy from 
which opium is produced. This is then exported to China in 
exchange for silks and tea thereby producing an entire nation of 
opium eaters. When the Chinese emperor resists the Company, 
the latter dispatches its Indian sepoys to fight and die for the 
Company's cause. ""The circle is complete"" declares Gordon 
and ""we call it the free market"". Not only Gordon, throughout 
the first half of the film there are repeated critiques of Company 
rule. For example, a villager declares to his cronies '.Jab saudagar 
ho raja, tab praja ke baaje baaja' (When the trader becomes 
ruler, the subjects face the music). Crown rule however is held 
up as more just, benign, and fair. Lord Canning is shown as 
holding up a toast to the queen and to British rule which he states 
majestically is epitomised by modern governance, scientific 
rationality, and the rule of law. The Company however is a 
mockery of each of these ideals. So much so, that one Lockwood 
has been sent over from Britain to investigate the misdemeanors 
of the Company's financial affairs.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=362

mockery of each of these ideals. So much so, that one Lockwood 
has been sent over from Britain to investigate the misdemeanors 
of the Company's financial affairs. All this is reminiscent of what Nicholas Dirks has felicitously 
phrased ""the scandal of Empire"". For Dirks, the empire was 
scandalous not only in terms of the private loot carried on by 
Company officials, but also in its misuse and abuse ""of other 
grants, treaties, agreements, and understandings, each of which 
... became the pretext for the assumption of sovereign rights over 
trade, revenue, law and land on the part of a monopoly joint 
stock company that was at the same time systematically violating 
the terms of its own relationship to the Crown and Parliament of 
England."" 8Yet, within the narrative structure of the film Mangal 
Pandey's anti-Company actions are not fuelled by any of these 
miscarriages of justice. In fact he is amenable, albeit with great 
mental agony and anxiety, to countenance a fellow Indian 
servant being abused by one Captain Hewson as a ""black dog"" 
and beaten up mercilessly. He even shoots upon hapless villag­
ers who produced opium at the Company's behest. He shares his
Mangal Pandey: Film and History 309 
frustrations with Gordon, his friend and trusted superior. Perhaps the strength of the friendship gives him the wherewithal 
to carry on in the employment of the Company. It is not until he 
is convinced of the truth in the rumours about the use of cow and 
pig fat in the cartridges meant for use in the newly introduced 
Enfield rifles that Pandey turns rebellious. If the first half of the film revolves around the friendship 
between Pandey and Gordon, the second half depicts its 
unravelling. It was Gordon's assurance that the Company was 
cognisant of the sepoy's religious beliefs that persuaded Pandey 
to bite off the greased cartridge. But, gradually the rumours that 
the cartridges were greased with substances considered profane 
by both Hindus and Muslims gather steam until Pandey and his 
other sepoy cohort pay a visit to the cartridge factory run by a 
Parsi businessman. In a scene bordering on the absurd we see 
bubbles of cow and pig fat bubbling in large cauldrons and 
animal carcasses strewn and hung all around the inside of the

364,"But, gradually the rumours that 
the cartridges were greased with substances considered profane 
by both Hindus and Muslims gather steam until Pandey and his 
other sepoy cohort pay a visit to the cartridge factory run by a 
Parsi businessman. In a scene bordering on the absurd we see 
bubbles of cow and pig fat bubbling in large cauldrons and 
animal carcasses strewn and hung all around the inside of the 
factory. Pandey stumbles out disgusted and disillusioned. His 
greatest concern at this point however is that he has lost his high 
caste status and has become an untouchable like Nainsukh. The 
first half of the film had several sequences where Pandey is 
shown spurning Nainsukh for defiling him with his touch follYw­
ing Pandey's purificatory early morning bathing ritual in the 
Ganges. But once he is assured by the other sepoys that an act 
committed in ignorance is not debilitating to one's caste status 
Pandey galvanises into action. He pays a late night visit to Gordon returning to him a pistol 
that had been a gift from the Englishman to Pandey when he 
saved his life in the Afghan war. Having severed the knot with 
Gordon, Pandey begins to plan rebellion and the overthrow of 
the Company raj. In this his close collaborator is one subahdar 
Zafar Khan, a Muslim official in the Company's army. The film 
explicitly invokes Hindu-Muslim solidarity in the rising against 
the British. The use of a Sufi song, Hindus showing respect for 
Muslim religious practices and visiting Sufi shrines creates 
images of a syncretic and secular culture. It is also at this point 
that the film raises the most interesting questions about the 
nature of sovereignty under colonialism. As Pandey and his 
colleagues meet up with Afzal Khan (modelled on Azimullah 
Khan?), a representative of Nana Sahib and Tatya Tope, the
310

latter solicit the sepoys' support in their crusade against the East 
India Company. Pandey's retort to them is significant. He 
accuses the maharajas and other princely scions of having 
relinquished their kingdoms to the Company without any signifi­
cant resistance. He charges them of being slothful and wedded 
to a life of luxury and splendour. As a member of the Company's 
army, he has witnessed the infighting and lack of initiative 
among the maharajas. Thus there was no way that he would 
exchange one set of corrupt rulers, the East India company for 
another, the kings and princes of Hindustan. When asked who 
would replace the Company's rule his one word response is ""the 
people"". He elaborates his point with words and sentiments that 
would have been anachronistic in the context of the mid-19th 
century. ""We are Hindustan"", says Pandey.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=364

would replace the Company's rule his one word response is ""the

rules on our strength"" .Just as iron alone can ""cut iron"", it is only 
the Company's army that can effectively challenge the Com­
pany. Returning once again to the theme of popular sovereignty 
he asserts that ""In England too only the coins bear the queen's 
insignia. It is the people who rule"". The battle to come was a 
battle for freedom. It was to be a battle that would ensure ""the 
freedom of the past for the freedom of the future"". In this war of 
freedom the one symbol that would hold together the rebel 
army, the princes, and all would be the Red Fort in Delhi and 
its elderly occupant Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal 
emperor. From here on the film proceeds rapidly to its climax. The 
sepoys' plot of declaring war on May 31 is foiled as the Company 
sends out for the queen's regiment from Rangoon to combat the 
rebels before that date. Caught unawares and unprepared a few 
days before their planned uprising, Pandey nonetheless fights 
almost single-handed with the English. But here too the focal 
point of the dramatic action is a duel between him and Captain 
Gordon where Pandey clearly emerges as the victor but spares 
Gordon his life. Seeing that he is about to be captured by the 
British he puts his chest on gun point and pulls the trigger. The 
British however want him alive so as to mete out exemplary 
punishment that would deter future rebellion. When Gordon 
tries to persuade a hospitalised Pandey that a guilty plea and 
apology might save his life Pandey refuses. Once again we 
hear sentiments whose intellectual provenance would belong

somewhere in the early 20th century but in the film are put in the 
mouth of an illiterate subaltern in the East India Company's 
army. He tells Gordon that for the longest time, he (Pandey) had 
treated Nainsukh as an untouchable. Now however it is clear to 
him that they (implying the colonised) were all untouchables 
without the right to raise their heads in their own land. His fight 
was no longer against the ""grease"" or against the cartridges. He 
was prepared to bite off a thousand cartridges if only that would 
win him his freedom.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=365

without the right to raise their heads in their own land. His fight

speak to his lady love Heera who comes to meet him before the 
hanging) are spoken to his friend Gordon. ""Hindustan is rising 
and no one can stop it 
not you, not me, not my life."" The flashback ends here. We are returned to the opening song 
of the film 'mangala mangala' and to the re-scheduled hanging. Except this time around the punishment will take place in the 
open with a surging crowd of spectators who have to be reined 
in by Company soldiers. Mangal Pandey escorted by the English 
soldiers appears on screen. Unlike in the opening scene this time 
he emerges head first, almost as if he is rising from the ashes. Indeed he is a new man. Gone are his allegiances as a paid 
Company sepoy, his pride as a brahmin, as a man who used to 
loathe prostitutes. He emerges as the first future citizen who is 
martyring himself for his country. The slow emergence of this 
figure - head first with a prominent red tilak on his forehead, 
followed by his muscular arms bound to a bamboo pole, his legs 
in chains all seem to signal the emergence of an unmarked 
citizen subject who is martyring himself for his country. The 
significance of his still wearing the sacred thread seems to have 
been negated by his earlier statements about untouchability. As 
he is marched to the gallows his eyes stare straight ahead. The 
only person he casts a sidelong glance at is Gordon. The next few 
scenes unfold swiftly. Pandey shouts his last words ""Halla Bol"" 
exhorting the massive crowd to rise in rebellion. His body, 
shown from a distance whooshes up, and a deathly silence 
descends upon the crowd. After this momentary lull, it is 
Nainsukh the untouchable who follows Pandey's cry, yells 
""Halla Bol"" and breaks through the barricade of British sold!ers. The mutiny has begun. The crowd that had gathered to view the 
spectacle of Pandey's death rushes forth on the field in a manner 
reminiscent of the exultant crowd of villagers after the cricket

are informed that this was one of the ""bloodiest battles in human 
history"". It put an end to the Company's Raj in India and led to 
the Queen's proclamation in 1858. Historical records have apparently noted that an English 
officer named Gordon fought on the side of the sepoys. While 
the British termed this event the ""mutiny"", Orn Puri's baritone 
tells us for Indians it has remained the ""first war of indepen­
dence"" and Mangal Pandey is one of the first martyrs of that war. There is a rapid succession of portraits. f'irst it is Queen Victoria, 
whose face dissolves into Mangal Pandey's whose face in turn 
dissolves into found footage showing Gandhi and familiar 
scenes reminiscent of Gandhian civil disobedience. Pandey's 
dream we are informed was realised in 1947 when Nehru is 
shown hoisting the Indian national flag. TRAVESTY OF HISTORY? Very little indeed is known about the historical person 
Mangal Pandey, a member of No 5 Company of the 34th Native 
Infantry at Barrackpore, who ""mutinied"" some time late in the 
afternoon of March 29, 1857.9 His presence in the actual history 
of 1857 seems to have been shadowy. On the one hand, there is 
the claim that ""his actions precipitated the mutinyjrebellion of 
1857"" . 10 But it is at the very least uncertain whether Pandey's 
individual act of mutiny can be said to have precipitated 1857, 
for the grievances over greased cartridges had been festering for 
some time. 11 Some of the histories of 1857 published in the years 
immediately following the events do not -even when they mention 
the Mangal Pandey episode - cast him in the role of a catalyst. William Howard Russell, ""the first war correspondent"" who wrote 
on the Crimean War and who came to India in 1858 to report on 
""the rumours on atrocities against British men, women and children 
... and to inquire into the circumstances of the failure of the British 
rule in India which had been brought to light by the Mutiny"", did 
not even mention Mangal Pandey in his published diaries. 12 
Yet it is clear at the same time that the British had some 
perception of a general discontent over questions of religion and 
greased cartridges that was growing among the sepoys and that 
Mangal Pandey typified for them.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=367

the Bengal Civil Service and the financial commissioner for 
Awadh in what he wrote in his contemporary account of the 
""munies in Oudh"". It was in April 1857 that Gubbins said, 
""ul)easiness fitst begun to be felt by the authorities at Lucknow 
respecting the allegiance of the native soldiers quartered at that 
capital. During the two preceding months, the newspapers had 
made known the general repugnance felt by the sepoys to the use 
of the new cartridges. We had heard of the mutiny of the 19th 
Regiment of Native Infantry at Berhampore, and its disband­
ment at Barrackpore. The feelings of the disbanded soldiers was 
known to be anything but friendly"".13 George Treveleyan's book

mutiny that suggests the figure of a nationalist hero. In most 
accounts of Pandey in his state of rebellion - when he came out 
wearing his ""regimental dress"" on top of his dhoti and carrying 
a loaded musket - is described as calling out to his comrades 
exhorting them to come out and defend their religion. There is 
nothing about the freedom of the country in the early reports of 
his statements. There is, of course, some debate about whether 
he was under the influence of ""bhang or opium, or both""; it was 
also suggested at the time that he ""suffered from epilepsy"" - but 
that by itself is neither here nor there. 17 Local histories that

only way to make him into a hero is to create a composite character 
-stick into the sketchy outlines we have of his life details from other 
places, other lives and other times. Anachronism has to be the 
name of the game. William Dalrymple is probably right in his 
observation in his recent book, The Last Mughal, that it was the 
young Savarkar who first raised Pandey to the status of b¥ng an 
icon of Indian nationalism.21 Savarkar devoted a chapter1to him 
in his nationalist-classic, The Indian War of Independence. The 
chapter is significantly tit;led 'Shahid Mangal Pandey'. 22 Savarkar 
portrays Pandey as a hero of 1857 by describing him as a ""valiant 
young man"" and ""a brahmin (who) took up the duties of a 
kshatriya,"" whose love of""his religion"" was more than_ that of""his 
life"". ""Pure in his private life and undaunted in battle, the idea 
of the freedom of his country had entered and electrified his

brahmin sepoy about' his caste-consciousness while informing 
him of the greased cartridges was an incident that reportedly 
took place in Dum Dum in January 1857 1and was not a part of 
the historical Mangal Pandey's pfe. 27 Nor 'would they know that 
it was around Meerut and about May in 1857 that ""courtesans of 
the bazaar brothels"" began to taunt the troopers, ""egging on. the 
men to rescue their85 comrades from the gaol"".28Nor would the 
delightfully creative anachrop.ism of a character like Captain 
Gordon be obvious to the viewer. As several scholars have 
pointed out, the sepoy-officer relationship was actually undergo­
ing a change between c 1820 and 1850 as the older type of 
officers who ""wrestled"" with their sepoys and ""gave nautches for 
the regiment"" were being replaced by a new type - men who 
knew less of the sepoys and of their langµages and practices, men 
who readily address the latter as ""nigger"" or 'suwar' (pig). Sir

Richard Hilton, once a major-general in the British-Indian. army, who wrote a ""centenary history"" of 1857, sought to 
assist his mid-20th-century reader with another parallel, stereo­

in India had trac:Utionally been relatively fluid, underwent a 
process of ""Sanskritisation"", as the sepoys came to understand 
such issues being central to their notions of self respect. ""32 This 
point was not unfamiliar to the British in the 19th century. Sir Charles Na pier had issued a warning long before 1857. He 
said: ""The most important thing which I reckon injurious to the

Indian army is the immense influence given to caste; instead of 
being discouraged, it has been encouraged in the Bengal army; 
in the Bombay army it is discouraged; and that army is in better 
order than the army of Bengal, in which the brahmins have been 
leaders in every mutiny.""33 There is no such historical perspective in MP. Much ink has, 
therefore, been understandably dispensed in both India and the 
UK on the factual errors that are strewn throughout MP. Saul 
David noted that while he was no ""apologist of the East India 
Company"", there is no ""evidence"" that supports the film's 
assertions pertaining to prostitution and slavery. 34 He also 
questioned the idea, so central to the film, that the events of 1857 
were sparked off by the East India Company using cartridges 
greased with cow and pig fat. Interestingly, two books (although 
from different vantage points) on Mangal Pandey were pub­
lished in India the same year that the film was released. One of

his title. The other by Rudrangshu Mukherjee, Mangat Pandey: 
Brave Martyr or Accidental Hero? adopts a more complex under­
standing of Pandey.35 Mukherjee (basing his observations upon 
works by authors like Kaye, Malleson and others) draws atten­
tion to the fact that Mangal Pandey was a name that continued 
to haunt the British. The myth that surrounds the name of 
Mangal Pandey writes Mukherjee, ""is a British creation"". Briefly, 
Mukherjee's arguments can be summarised as follows: Pandey 
had acted in a fit of intoxication. The revolt of 1857 was a 
collective endeavour without a single author. To ascribe its 
origins to the acts of a lone, inebriated sepoy would therefore be 
historically fallacious. Yet historians' objections to MP, while they may have been 
based on facts, are surprising as the film begins with a disclaimer 
that should have disarmed the historically-minded. The disclaimer 
appears before the title sequence and says in no uncertain 
terms that: This story is based on actual events. In certain cases incidents, 
characters and timelines have been changed or fictionalised for 
dramatic purposes. Certain characters may be dramatic composites or 
entirely fictitious. Some names and locations have been changed. The 
scenes depicted may be a hybrid of fact and fiction which fairly
318 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week(y 
represent the source materials for the film believed to be true by the 
filmmakers. There is no denying that MP creates Mangal Pandey into a 
composite character. He is not entirely fictitious but he is not 
entirely historical either. There is little doubt from the start that 
this is not a ""historical"" that is about history alone. To criticise 
the film in terms of its historical shortcomings is to make a 
confusion of categories or genres. This point is simple enough 
and would not be unknown to our historians. Why then the 
confusion and the subsequent criticisms? MEDIA, MEMORY, AND THE POLITICS OF THE PEOPLE This is where we enter the more speculative and the conclud­

effigy of filmmaker Ke tan Mehta at the district headquarters. The 
Indian Express reported that the film was considered offensive by 
the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Mulayarn Singh Yadav who 
issued a statement saying that ""his government was examining 
the film after charges that the script had showed the freedom war 
hero visiting a brothel"". The fact that the film did not mention 
Pandey's native village Nagwa was also found highly objection­
able. ""These are issues related to the legendary hero and cannot 
be taken lightly, since it hurts public sentiments and will be 
banned if the allegations are found to be true"", declared 
Yadav. :,7 A kind of mass hysteria accompanied the release of the 
film in certain pockets of the country. Since Pandey belonged to

history but it has some specifically Indian inflections as well. 40 
Let us briefly recapitulate the transnational aspect of the prob­
lem first. Historians (with individual exceptions) have 
often expressed a degree of concern about filmic rendition of 
the past. An eminent historian of our times, for instance, reports 
a certain feeling of unease with the way film-makers market 
""experience"" as a way of getting access to the past. We refer here 
to Natalie Davis' discussion of two films, Stephen Spielberg's 
Amistad and Oprah Winfrey' s Beloved, both depicting slavery on 
screen. Winfrey thus explained her own objectives in creating 
this filmic rendition of Toni Morrison's novel: ""I wanted people 
to be able to feel deeply on a very personal level what it meant 
to be a slave, what slavery did to people, and also be liberated 
by that knowledge"". She is reported to have said to her scriptwriter 
and fellow-producer, ""This is my Schindler's List"".41 Spielberg 
similarly used"" considerable dramatic licence"", reports Davis, in 
Amistad so as to make it ""symbolic of a struggle that continues 
to this day"" in the form of ""immigrants brought in illegally to 
work in sweatshops""}2 Davis, as a historian, is clearly unhappy 
about this collapsing of the distance between the past and the 
present. She does not go as far as Louis Gottschalk of the

But, clearly, it has been a losing battle in the last 70 odd years 
for those on Gottschalk's side. Davis presents a weaker version 
of the Gottschalk argument but, for her, the presentism that is 
often endemic to filmic representation is an issue. She writes: 
""The play of imagination in picturing resistance to slavery can 
follow the rules of evidence when possible, and the spirit of 
evidence when details are lacking.""44 At the very least, film-makers 
should follow the principle of separating the past from the present 
and not collapse that distinction into one single experience. ""Strange­
ness in history"", she writes, should be sustained ""along with 
familiar"". Or, as she puts it in another place in the book: 
historical films should ""let the past be the past"".45 The film-studies critic Tom Gunning has clarified what threat­
ens the enterprise of the historian here. He emphasises how films 
make the past available by making it vivid thereby converting it 
directly into an object of embodied ""experience"". This is very 
different from the ideal of re-enacting the past in the historian's 
mind. In Gunning's words: 
... film provides indelible images of some of the 20th century's great 
events. Our horrified consciousness of the Holocaust relies partly on 
the filmed images from the liberation of the camps, and our knowledge 
of the devastation of the Atomic_ bomb comes partly from motion 
pictures of Hiroshima or of A-bomb test explosions. Conversely, 
twentieth-century disasters or traumas that went unrecorded by mo­
tion pictures - such as the genocide of the Armenians or mass 
starvation in Asia - are less present in public consciousness because 
of the lack of vivid images... .",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=378

evidence in the same way that other representational art forms do - by 
making events vivid ... . [A]s a form of mass visual entertainment, films 
reflect social attitudes in a specific and vivid manner. 46 
Such vividness that is not mediated and controlled by 
the abstract form of historical reasoning that academic historians
Mangal Pandey: Film and History 321 
employ could, it is feared, destroy the principle of historical 
objectivity. At issue here is not just the aesthetic or academic question of 
historical objectivity. This objectivity, one may argue, is a critical 
tool of a certain conception of democracy as well. The question 
can therefore easily become political. The coming of mass­
media emphasising audio-visual forms of reception and judg­
ment has globally changed the nature of the public sphere in 
democracies. Instead of the 18th century model described by 
Habermas a public sphere based, ultimately, on the individual's 
capacity for disembodied reasoning, a ""brains in vats"" model, 
really 
we have public spheres animated by the direct appeal 
to the senses (as well as reasoning) that a medium like films can 
make. (Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is an excellent case 
in point.} One can read what was said for and against MP in the Indian 
press as a version of this transnational or global debate about 
democracy. But the debate takes on a particular form in India, 
and especially so when it comes to remembering 1857. The 
business of remembering 1857 has always split Indians, one 
could say. On the one hand, there is the tradition that Savarkar 
inaugurated of calling 1857 the first war of independence. This 
tradition has never quite died. Leaving aside the question of use 
of Savarkar by nationalists such as Subhas Chandra Bose and 
confining our remarks to academics alone, it is interesting to see 
that even R C Majumdar, who otherwise disagreed with 
SB Chaudhuri's characterisation of 1857 as a ""civil distur­
bance"", judged that Mangal Pandey ""fully deserves the honour 
of the first martyr which posterity has given him"".",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=379

Mukherjee saw 1857 as a ""popular"" rebellion which SN Sen, 
CA Bayly, and others have granted in the case of Awadh. 48 And, 
indeed, as we have stated before, Om Puri's voice-over in MP 
clearly calls 1857 ""the first war of independence"". Some very eminent nationalists, on the other hand, opposed 
the Savarkar line of thinking soon after independence. Consider 
the then education minister Maulana Abul Kalam Azad's Fore­
word to SN Sen's official centenary history of 1857. Azad asked 
for an ""objective"" piece of history in order to oppose the way of 
thinking associated with Savarkar. He wrote, referring indirectly 
to Savarkar: ""Some Indians have written on the struggle in the
322 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
early years of this century. If the truth is to be told, ... the books 
they have written are not history but mere propaganda. These 
authors wanted to represent the uprising as a planned war of 
independence organised by the nobility of India against the 
British government."" This, Azad thought, was baseless. It was 
""ridiculous"", for instance, to consider Ali Naqi Khan ""one of the 
chief conspirators"" when he was ""completely a henchman of the 
East India Company"" and whom the people of Lucknow ""looked 
upon ... as a traitor"". 49

Indian politics ever since it happened. The Quit India move­
ment in Bihar often brought back - both to the nationalists and

memories of it.50The mobilisation against 
vasectomy in northern India during the Emergency reminded 
many of the events of the 19th century, and with the advent of 
Subaltern Studies in the 1980s, Ranajit Guha famously saw in 
1857 a paradigmatic form of peasant insurgency that was central 
to his conceptualisation of Indian politics having two necessary 
domains and idioms: an elite one represented by leaders such as 
Nehru and a ""popular"" or subaltern one that classically followed 
and expressed the logic of insurgency that Guha discerned in 
1857 and other similar events.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=380

We submit that the concerns expressed around Aamir Khan's 
and Ketan Mehta's portrayal of Mangal Pandey speak to an 
unresolved question of Indian democracy, a question that 
acquires urgency the more mass forms of democracy take root 
in India. This is the question of the two domains - to stay for the 
moment with Guha's formulation - could be combined into a 
""politics of the people"" that would give Indian democracy both 
a working sense of sovereignty (an effective rule of law, that is) 
and a lively sense of being truly a democracy ( a rule of the 
demos). The Constitution was written in the name of a category 
called ""the people oflndia"". That was an example of performative 
speech. But in the everyday we have had several and very 
different 
and one might even say, competing - ways of 
imagining what a ""politics of the people"" might look like and 
how the category ""people"" might be represented in politics. There, firstly, was the Nehruvian imagination of ""the people"" 
after independence - a ""people"" as committed to the nation as 
the nation was committed to its people(s). In the world of
Mangal Pandey: Film and History 323 
Bombay films, this equation of a romanticised category called 
""the people"" with the nation shifted from the historical to the 
social in the period immediately after independence. This 
imaginary was most vividly brought to life in song sequences

became the ground of play for ""the people"".",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=381

people"" as sovereign despite their financial impoverishment 
and other social handicaps. But this 1950s imagination of the people as the subaltern 
equivalent of the nation withered as the decades wore on and the 
older nationalist or socialist imagination of the ""masses"" as a 
united agency ceased to be viable. Politics of caste, of dalit self­

also simultaneously hypostatising a greater category- the people. MP, like some other films that Khan appeared in, resonates with 
an effort to grapple with the present, to find succour for the 
problems of the contemporary by recasting the past. Interest­
ingly, all these films bypass the immediate post-independence 
decades, a close engagement with which might offer a more 
linear account of the present. Instead all of these films undertake 
a temporal loop into the colonial period in which they embed the 
category of the people. The films appear to pose viewers with the

between the ""popular"" and the ""democratic"". The Nehruvian 
dream of an orderly, disciplined (we use this word advisedly) 
democracy comes up everyday against the resistance of ""popu­
lar"" politics of various kinds. At the centre of these clashes 
internal to the cultures of Indian democracy are questions of 
pedagogy. How will we learn to make our society ever more 
democratic? Can we have a democracy that abandons the ideals 
of a Habermasian public sphere and the rule oflaw? But who will 
instil these ideas and in whom? Who will be the teachers and who 
will be the taught? It is on these kinds of questions that elitist 
answers founder. Will the ""people"" be merely an object of 
representation or will they, in some ways, speak directly for 
themselves? Can they be their own teachers? The anxiety 
expressed by some on this score seems legitimate, for - as 1857 
and numerous other instances of subaltern politics make clear -
while there is something inherently democratic about the popular,
Mangal Pandey: Film and History 325 
the popular by itself does not ever guarantee the achievement of 
a democratic culture that, say, treasures the individual or the 
right of dissent. Aamir Khan's Mangal Pandey speaks to this 
dilemma that is quite central to the evolving politics of 
Indian democracy.53

while there is something inherently democratic about the popular,
Mangal Pandey: Film and History 325 
the popular by itself does not ever guarantee the achievement of 
a democratic culture that, say, treasures the individual or the 
right of dissent. Aamir Khan's Mangal Pandey speaks to this 
dilemma that is quite central to the evolving politics of 
Indian democracy.53

391,"The voice of the 
common people had been invisibilised in history for a long time. However attempts have been made to bring common people to 
the forefront of history. The past is being excavated from the 
viewpoint of the subaltern. Women's voices are also being 
brought to the forefront. Still a significant section of women's 
history, especially of those on the margins 
considered the 
""other"" woman in the construction of middle class women 
remains invisible. The ""other"" women represented common 
women, considered to be coarse, vulgar, loud, morally de­
graded and sexually promiscuous. Having greater access to the 
public sphere, these women were relatively independent, out­
side rigid formations and not so clearly contained by caste, 
class, gender or a demarcated space, and so considered threat­
ening. Bringing these women as subjects into history would 
unsettle the middle class ""respectable"" discourse. One important section that has been excluded from history 
is women performers. Nationalist discourses have always ne­
gated or erased their creative aspect by keeping them out of the 
framework of the respectable nation. The question of 
""respectability"" assumed its sharpest form with regard to issues 
concerning women, as redefinition of the female was a crucial 
feature of the hegemony that brought the middle class into 
power. If the struggle to represent ideal female behaviour 
accompanied the struggle of an emergent middle class, then 
change in the representation of women would be expected to
330 1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week(y 
accompany more extensive historical changes. The representa­
tion of women as public entertainer and locus of male desire no 
longer served the interests of the English-educated elite, who 
put in her place the Indian equivalent of the Victorian domestic 
angel, the ""sugrihini"" or good-housewife [Sangari and Vaid 
1989]. Female performers became stigmatised in educated 
discourse as ""prostitutes"". This article brings to the forefront one such performing 
community, that is, courtesans, a section of women belonging to 
a singing and dancing community. Generally depiction of the 
characters of courtesans is extremely iconic. There are fictions 
about them. They acquire in their ordinariness and everyday­
ness an archetypal image. 'Tawaif, the term used for a courte­
san, has accumulated over time moralistic, value-loaded conno­
tations; in the popular mindset it was equated to a whore, forcing 
these women performers into silence. When they did speak, 
they had to reinvent themselves through polite myths to rein­
force their self-esteem, which had consistently been battered by 
references to them as fallen and dangerous women. They had to 
constantly camouflage their personas, a crucial process to make 
them into the legends that they were.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=391

constantly camouflage their personas, a crucial process to make 
them into the legends that they were. By the end of the 19th 
century, tawaif had become an impolite word not used in 
genteel conversation; in the popular mindset the tawaif was 
equated to a whore. Unfortunately little remains of the writings 
of these women, considered to be the most educated women of 
their times. Many did write poetry, but even this seems to have 
been censored out of literary canon. Compounding the silence 
of these women has been the silence of scholars, thus leaving 
gaping holes in social history [Kidwai 2004]. Even in the writings 
of feminist scholars, these women have remained invisible. The 
feminists were limited by their own class bias and by their 
continued adherence to a ""separate sphere"" ideology that stressed 
women's purity, moral supremacy and domestic virtues. This article is based on a present-day play 'Azizun Nisa San 
Sattavan Ka Kissa' (A Courtesan and 1857 Revolt, 1999) written 
by Tripurari Sharma, who is a playwright, director and profes­
sor of National School of Drama in New Delhi. In most of 
Tripurari Sharrna's work, voices of the marginalised section, 
especially women, provide the vantage point from which the 
contest over established nonns and practices of the dominant
1857: Visibilising the 'Other' in History 331 
order is brought to the forefront. The main protagonist of the 
play is Azizun Nisa, a courtesan, who joined the sepoys in 
Kanpur when they revolted against the British in 1857. Azizun 
Nisa used to dress like a man. She was very close to sepoys and 
during 1857 her place becomes an important meeting point for 
rebel sepoys. She is said to have been behind the massacre of 
the British women and children in Kanpur, which was part of the 
history of the mutiny. She was from Lucknow but had settled in 
Kanpur. She had a very public affair with Shamsuddin Sawar of 
the 42nd Cavalry, who was on the frontline of the mutiny in 
Kanpur and died in the revolt [Sharma 2005]. By looking at the 
role of courtesans in 1857 the author has added an important 
dimension to the historiography of revolt, which suffers from the 
same limitation, that is, the invisibility of common women.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=392

role of courtesans in 1857 the author has added an important 
dimension to the historiography of revolt, which suffers from the 
same limitation, that is, the invisibility of common women. The 
study on ""ordinary rebels"" of the 1857 rebellion remains 
focused on the participation of men [Stokes 1986; Bhadra 1988]. Barring leaders such as Rani Laxmibai, in most discussions of 
the rebellion, the participation of ordinary women has received 
little attention. That is why Sharma's play becomes very signifi­
cant from a historical point of view. There is historical evidence of these women playing a very 
significant role in politics but their political voice is invisibilised 
in mainstream history writing. The bedia community, a tradi­
tional caste whose profession is singing and dancing, associates 
with the event of 1857 with great pride. Evidence is also coming 
in as to how women from the singing community raised money 
for the Congress Party. They generously gave of their time when 
they had to raise money for charity. Jaddan Bai financially 
helped the left-leaning Progressive Writers' Association. But 
their presence caused an uneasy tension amongst the middle 
class. The presence of Gauhar Jan, India's first recording 
megastar, at a Congress session was objected to by respectable 
lady supporters and the singer was asked to keep away. It is said 
that once, piqued that Gandhi did not show up for one of her 
fund-raising events, sending a representative instead, she do­
nated only half of what she had promised [Kidwai 2004:49]. Thus Sharma's play can be seen as an attempt to rewrite 
dominant versions of historical truth and relocate the ""loose"" 
subjects of colonial history into their proper roles in anti-colonial 
struggles too. Besides, what makes the play particularly significant is
332 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
not just retrieving those on the margins, which were denied agency 
or a presence by the colonialist project of (mis)representations, but 
also to bring them back into the creative domain. II The play has an element of historicity as the author has 
looked at historical records, documents and memoirs in the 
library and archives. Azizun Nisa's name is mentioned in 
historical records and she is reported to have played an 
important role in the 1857 Revolt in Kanpur. In Kanpur, Azizun 
Nisa is alive in people's minds and memory and people talk 
about her with great fervour and passion. 1",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=393

evidence of courtesans playing a role in the 1857 revolt. Their 
role is documented as covert but get generous financiers of the 
action. These women, though patently non-combatants, were 
penalised for their alleged instigation of and pecuniary assis­
tance to the rebels. The British officials were aware that their 
homes functioned as meeting points and looked upon these 
places with suspicion, as dens of political conspiracy. In fact, 
after quelling the rebellion of 1857 the British turned their fury 
against the powerful elite of Lucknow. The courtesans' names 
were on the lists of property confiscated by British officials for 
proven involvement in the siege and rebellion against colonial 
rule in 1857 [Talwar Oldenburg 1984]. There is a view that the courtesans participated in the 1857 
Revolt because they were under the control of nawabs. Nawabs 
were against the British as colonial rule had eroded their power. However, this argument denies agency and political voice to 
these women. According to Sharma, it was not necessary for the 
courtesans to participate even if they were under the nawabs. Azizun Nisa could have done anything, could have even for­
saken the revolt and left, as fighting and dying for a cause is very 
rare. There was no compulsion or pressure on her to participate 
in the revolt. In fact, Azizun Nisa was not even under anybody's 
protection. She stayed in Kanpur city and ran her 'kotha'. Her 
mother was a courtesan in Lucknow. So Azizun Nisa must have 
left the city of Lucknow, a centre of culture, where the courte­
sans enjoyed patronage and settled in Kanpur. Sharma feels that 
her reason for coming to Kanpur may have been her strong 
passion for independence. She probably did not want to stay

'bazaars' and not liked by the courtesans. They felt that the

subcontinent before the British began to displace the rulers. Lucknow emerged as an important cultural centre. The courte­
sans of Lucknow established themselves as a notable group of 
women in the 80 odd years that the Avadh dynasty had 
Lucknow as its capital city, under the lavish patronage of the 
chief noblemen, merchants, and the official elite. Ensconced in 
equally lavish apartments in the bazaars of Chowk and in the 
Kaiser Bagh, they were not only recognised as preservers and 
performers of the high culture of the court, but actively shaped 
the developments in Hindustani music and kathak dance styles. Their style of entertainment was widely imitated in other Indian 
court cities. They commanded great respect in the court and in 
society and association with them bestowed prestige on those 
who were invited to their salons for cultural soirees. It was not 
uncommon for the young sons of the nobility to be sent to the 
best known salons for instruction in etiquette, the art of con­
versation and polite manners, and the appreciation of Urdu 
literature. They were artists who had to undergo rigorous 
training. Many of the musicians belonged to famous lineages 
and much of late 19th centurv Hindustani music was invented 
and transformed in these sflons, to accommodate the new 
urban elite who filled the patronage vacuum in the colonial 
period. Courtesans were valued patrons of poets, scholars, holy 
men and most importantly talented musicians and dancers 
[Manuel 1987: 12-17; Sharar 1975: 192; Talwar Oldenburg 1984: 
131-42; Kidwai 2004: 50J. The play tries to assert this creative aspect of the courtesans. According to Sharma ""by asserting that courtesans are creative 
people I wanted to question the general notion that these 
women are 'public' women and available for all. These women
334 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week(y 
have command over language, music and dance.""3 Sharma 
emphasises how these women were trained in the art of conver­
sation which is gradually becoming lost in society. The charac­
ter of Azizun Nisa is portrayed as that of a very talented artiste. She has a deep commitment to art and considers herself a poet­
lyricist and an artiste. She emphasises that one does not become 
a courtesan by just leaving home but stresses that a dancer has to 
undergo rigorous training.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=395

accusations are baseless. I am not a prostitute. I am a dancer. I am 
an artiste. I do not wear the veil but I'm not a public woman. People 
in the city ... acknowledge me as a courtesan, a poet, a lyricist. I'm 
not in the flesh trade"" [Sharma 2005: 133]. The courtesans were professional and business women, 
making an independent life for themselves. They organised 
funds, paid people and arranged for travels. They owned 
property and paid taxes. Their names were mentioned in 
Lucknow city's civic tax ledger of 1858-77. Some of the courte­
sans were in the highest tax bracket, with the largest individual 
incomes of any in the city. Their names were also on lists 
of property (houses, orchards, manufacturing and retail estab­
lishments for food and luxury items) confiscated by British 
officials for their proven involvement in the seize of Lucknow 
and the rebellion against colonial rule in 1857 [Talwar Oldenburg 
1984: 145-80]. They ran full-fledged establishments where dancing girls had 
to be hired and trained, musicians to be arranged and many 
other arrangements to be made. Courtesans were usually part of 
a larger establishment run by a 'chaudharayan', or chief courtesan, 
an older woman who has retired to the position of manager after 
a successful career as a courtesan. Having acquired wealth and 
fame, such women were able to recruit and train women who 
came to them, along with the more talented daughters of the 
household. The chaudharayan always received a fixed proportion 
( approximately a third) of the earnings to maintain the apartments, 
pay to hire and train other dancing girls, and attract the 
musicians, chefs, and special servants that such establishments 
employed. The household had other functionaries.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=396

who - they lived in the lower floors of the house or in detached 
servant's quarters and were also often kinsmen - screened 
suspicious characters at the door, acted as protectors of the 
house, and spied on the activities of the police and medical 
departments [Talwar Oldenburg 1991]. Property passed from 
mother to daughters. The male children became the deprived 
gender and were entirely dependent on the mothers and sisters. When married, their wives looked after the household chores. It was the girls in whose education investments were made 
[Kidwai 2004: 50]. The courtesans were intelligent women unlike the notion that 
was held of them. They had to regularly deal with the local police 
and 'kotwals' in different ways, either through bribing or in their 
own innovative, ingenious ways. They knew where to fight and 
where not to and were conscious of their survival. They invented 
covert, non-confrontational and devious ways for their survival and 
gradually learnt to relate to or live in man's world. According to 
Sharma ""running the kotha and organising the performance needs 
skills and operations at various levels. But people do not recognise 
their skills and feel as if they are sitting in 'bazaar'"". 4 
IV The advent of British power marked the erosion of the 
cultural power of the courtesan. British rule had marked the loss 
of the protection and patronage of royal courts for courtesans; 
they were their main patrons. Courtesans could practise their 
skills freely in the kingdom of Wajid Ali Shah. However, with 
the British takeover, even the king became a powerless prisoner 
in exile along with his influential courtiers. The British govern­
ment overlooked the artistic and creative element of the kothas 
and equated them with brothels. The identity of the courtesans 
was adversely affected. They were targeted by the same medical 
laws (Britain's Contagious Disease Act of 1864) to control 
veneral diseases afflicting European soldiers along with prostitutes, 
which were implemented for the prostitutes in order to regulate, 
inspect and control them.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=397

cities of the Indian empire. It became imperative that the 
courtesans and prostitutes of Lucknow, along with those in the 
other 110 cantonments in India where European soldiers were 
stationed, be regulated, inspected, and controlled (Talwar 
Oldenburg 1991:28-33). The collective impact of these regulations, the loss of court 
patronage and later the material penalities extracted from 
courtesans for their role in the 1857 rebellion were a severe 
blow to them and signalled the gradual debasement of an 
esteemed cultural institution into common prostitution. The 
British had perceived the courtesans as an integral part of the 
elite. In a campaign waged against them to reduce their 
influence, the new government assumed control over much of 
the prime real estate given to them by the Nawabs, and dis­
credited the nobility who associated with them as dissolute and 
immoral. Yet, when it came to matters such as using these 
women as prostitutes for the European garrison, or collecting 
income tax, the eminently pragmatic British set aside their high 
moral dudgeon, and decreed rules to make this possible. It 
became official policy to select the healthy and beautiful 
""specimens"" from among the kotha women, and arbitrarily 
relocate them in the cantonment for the convenience and health 
of the European soldiers. This not only dehumanised the 
profession, stripping it of its cultural function, but made sex 
cheap and easy for men while exposing women to venereal 
infection from the soldiers. Stripped of their privileges under the 
control of the colonial army, courtesans fought against this 
assault on their person, their property, and their ""immorality"", 
in other words, from then on down to the present day they 
struggle to retain their validity and some of the tangible benefits 
of a professional group (Talwar Oldenburg 1991:33]. According to Sharma, That these women are treasure houses for culture and expressions are 
devalued, conveniently forgotten and consequently lost, and they are 
seen merely as entertainers and available for sex work. These are two 
distinct things.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=398

the courtesans were not available for all. Their relationship was of 
choice. This has done a great damage to these women, their bodies, 
their identity and culture. Today in the common parlance the meaning 
of kotha is brothel. The dancing and singing community have to
1857: Visibilising the 'Other' in History 337 
struggle hard to fight against this identity and insist that they are singers 
and dancers by caste and not available for money.5 The anger of the courtesans against British rule can be seen 
in this context. But looking at their participation in the 1857 
revolt merely from the point of such anger would be to overlook 
the courtesans' political consciousness and agency. They are not 
seen as political subjects and are even considered to have no 
values. Sharma's play has questioned such notions. She wants to 
stress that these women too had a conscience and values and 
knew where to compromise and where not to. Courtesans felt 
the same way about their conscience as soldiers with strong 
feelings for their homeland vis-a-vis the British raj did. The 
soldiers were faced with a conflict between their own culture and 
people and loyalty to the British from whom they were drawing 
their salary. Sharma highlights that the courtesans were also 
faced with such conflict. It was not an easy decision for them to 
participate in the revolt. Taking to bloodshed and war is never 
an easy decision. So for Azizun Nisa it was a moral and spiritual 
decision too. Sharma says: 
There was a temptation to highlight in the play that the courtesans had lots 
of anger against the British and wanted to take revenge because of the cases 
of rape in British mehfils. This anger and revenge would have helped in 
building dramatic devices in the play but I restrained. I treated it at a 
different level. I felt that there was a level of rationality involved in 
courtesans' participation. Azizun Nisa's participation was a call of con­
science and not a craving for personal gain or political power. A large 
section of the ruling class and landlords participated in the 1857 revolt 
because of their political and economic interests.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=399

Saheb and Laxmi Bai, some of the main leaders, were from the ruling 
classes who were directly affected. To Laxmi Bai the issue was securing the 
throne for her son. But for Azizun Nisa there was no such personal interest. Azizun Nisa in that way did not have any connection with any big power 
or influential man. She was involved with Shamsuddin, a rebel sepoy, who 
was not a powerful man but has just 30 or 40 horses under him. So 
Azizun Nisa's stake does not seem to be personal. She did not participate 
for personal or immediately recognisable reasons. There seem to be other 
motivations than just immediate factors. Her stake seems to be that of 
conscience, more of a desire to transcend.6 The play highlights the political subjectivity of these women 
performers. Often a rich debate on political matters takes 
place between them in the play. In fact, courtesans were very
338 1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekfy 
politically conscious. They were aware of contemporary politics 
and law, had connections among the local power elite and were 
also well informed about the history of the city. In their view, the 
British had deliberately muddled the truth about their kothas in 
order to denigrate Nawabi culture and to thus justify annexing 
the kingdom of Awadh in 1856 [Talwar Oldenburg 1991:33]. Thus by bringing the figure of the courtesan centrally into the 
political space, a space denied and invisibilised in nationalist 
discourse in its search for respectability, this article explores their 
public/political role. By foregrounding women such as Azizun 
Nisa, who is neither the ""respectable"" mother nor wife, the quint­
essential inspirational figures in the nationalist discourse, Sharma 
also disrupts and ruptures the dominant bourgeois nationalist 
discourse. It disrupts the trope of ""mother India"" that dominated 
anti-colonial (middle class) nationalist thought. NOTES

Music and Society in North India: 
From the Mughals to the Mutiny 
Jon Barlow, Lakshmi Subramanian 
THE dramatically transformed political and social dynamics 
that emerged in the aftermath of the Mutiny of 1857 determined the 
circumstances in which Inda-Islamic Hindustani music - or north 
Indian classical music - had to survive and adapt to ""the modem"". However, it was between 1707 and 1857 that its ethos, genres, 
aesthetic concerns and manner of performance came to be estab­
lished. Although its primary elements, the 'ragas' and 'talas' were 
ancient [Prajnananda 1981; Gautam 1980], the synthesis oflndian 
and Islamicate streams that had begun in the 13th century matured 
in this interregnum. Older musical forms were compounded 
and refurbished and new forms, especially of instrumental 
music, were developed. While late 19th and 20th century musicians 
elaborated and reworked these forms - 'khyal', 'thumri' and the 
instrumental music of the sitar and sarode - in the context of a 
new and increasingly dominant metropolitan dispensation, it 
was in the period following Aurangzeb that the regional net­
works of princely patronage had emerged.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=401

before and after the Mutiny, spread and survived the pressures 
of transition through these networks and these courts became 
the conduits for its passage into the world of modem urbanised 
India. The connection of musicians associated with the Gwalior 
court and with Maharashtrian students leading back to Pune and 
Bombay produced an important axis for khyal singing. 'Dhrupad' 
and instrumental music on the other hand found a fertile field in 
Calcutta where, from around the time of the Mutiny, the 
musicians in the retinue of the exiled Nawab Wajid Ali Shah 
interacted with the city's educated, modernising 'bhadralok'. Hindustani classical music in the 19th century was defined by 
the ascent of khyal, especially the 'gayaki' of Niamat Khan

music [Karnani 2005]. Most of its musical elements were derived 
from older religious, folk and theatrical musical traditions of 
India but its distinct, hybrid identity can be traced back to the 
performative traditions of the Persian court and the Indian Sufi

music right through this period was the central role played by 
the Seniah gharana (Miner 1997] of the Mughal court musician

Bilas Khan, and his daughter Saraswati. Throughout the 19th

who achieved excellence in instrumental music. In the case of 
khyal singing, although it was a genre with a long history of 
development, its transition from being the leading musical form

with the 'dhrupad' genre of Gwalior, which became the canoni­
cal musicological model when the emperor Akbar (1556-1605) 
appointed a core of Gwalior mµsicians to his darbar. Mian 
Tansen attained the leading rank among them. His successors 
were responsible for making critical innovations to the Persian 
(or Kashmiri) 'sehtar' and its mode of playing that led to the 
development of the modern instrumental music of the sitar and 
sarode. The Qawwal Bachche, who formed the basis of the 
Gwalior khyal gharana in the early 19th century, were musicians 
in the teaching line of Amir Khusrau's Chistiah musical 'silsila'. In the early 18th century some of them had become followers 
of the gayaki of the Seniah Niamat Khan 'Sadarang', which had 
raised the universal standard for contemporary musicality. The 
music of these Qawwal-Bachche Qawwals precipitated the 
emergence of the modern khyal style in all its artistic, technical 
and musicological excellence. For the greater part of the 18th and early 19th centuries, 
despite the devastation that tore north Indian society apart, the 
musical culture of northern India continued to move within an 
interlocking grid of courtly patronage, networks of Hindu 
devotional and Sufi mystical practices, and popular spaces of

its ""centrality"" became largely symbolic. The tragedy ofMughal

(1938) earlier formulations on cultural efflorescence in the 18th

work on the subject to locate the complex evolution of musical

forms that became identified as mainstream classical Hindustani 
music in the 20th century. 1 
MUSIC IN THE AGE OF CRISIS The articulation of Delhi's musical culture went through 
several identifiable changes in the course of the 18th century, 
corresponding closely to shifts in court politics and the changing 
social fabric. A line of faineant emperors, a fractious nobility 
bent on self-aggrandisement, the depredations of a series of 
plundering warlords and a series of agrarian uprisings that 
strained the flagging resources of the empire, created an impos­
sible situation with inevitable consequences. The distinguishing 
features of Mughal rule immediately following the death of 
Aurangzeb in 1707 were bitterly contested wars of succession 
that convulsed the army and the nobility. Politicking at the 
imperial court and an emerging tendency on the part of the 
nobility to convert their official positions into permanent fiefs 
challenged what remained of imperial authority. The result was 
a rapid disintegration of the empire, with its provinces, or 
'subas', breaking away. Compounding this rot in ""the great time 
of troubles"" were groups of powerful but eccentric outsiders, 
like the Bangash Afghans and the Rohillas, who were bent on 
carving out destinies for themselves.2 While the consequences of imperial Mughal decay were 
politically disastrous, the city of Delhi and its social fabric did

405,"Politicking at the 
imperial court and an emerging tendency on the part of the 
nobility to convert their official positions into permanent fiefs 
challenged what remained of imperial authority. The result was 
a rapid disintegration of the empire, with its provinces, or 
'subas', breaking away. Compounding this rot in ""the great time 
of troubles"" were groups of powerful but eccentric outsiders, 
like the Bangash Afghans and the Rohillas, who were bent on 
carving out destinies for themselves.2 While the consequences of imperial Mughal decay were 
politically disastrous, the city of Delhi and its social fabric did

not immediately register a decline. Even as signs of imminent 
municipal collapse appeared in the first quarter of the 18th 
century - evident in the shoe sellers' riots of 1729 [Irvine 1989] 
- the city continued to expand with staggeringly wealthy 
merchants and the nobility investing in architecture and the arts. The havelis or mansions of the nobles and leading merchants 
became mini courts and centres of cultural patronage, espe­
cially of music and the 'sama' associated with the Sufi circles in 
the city. We get a telling sense of the extravagant preoFcupa­
tions of Delhi's elites from the contemporary writer Mohammed 
Baksh Ashub, author of the Tarikh i Shahahadat i Farukhsiyar 
was julus i Muhammad Shah. Citing the example of Zafar Khan 
Roshan ud daulah who had ""amassed more wealth than what 
Pharaoh had dreamed to possess"" [Chenoy 1998], Ashub wrote 
of how Zafar Khan's house looked like a mountain of gold; how 
the walls and doors were lavishly gilded and decorated with 
costly tapestry and hangings of gold and the floors covered with 
carpets of the richest silk; how he went to the royal palace in 
costly state, always dressed in elegant, rich garments and 
attended by horsemen and servants, distributing money among 
the poor who thronged his way. Zafar Khan organised the 
ceremonies of Bara Wafat (the prophet's birthday) and the Urs 
of Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki on a grand scale, making them 
unusually spectacular and impressive by decorating streets and 
roads with bright lights. Once a week, Zafar Khan held a Majlis 
i Sama to which he invited mystics, saints, ulema and pious 
persons of the city. In a state of ecstasy he tore up his golden 
clothes and distributed the pieces among the singers, offering 
coins of gold and silver to them. When the music was over, the 
gathering was entertained with sumptuous meals served in gold 
and silver ware (ibid). The account is telling in various ways, besides pointing to a 
sort of vulgarisation within Delhi's cultural practices. Musical 
patronage was central to the culture of Mughal India and was at 
once a court prerogative and simultaneously, integrally and 
intimately bound up with Sufi mystical devotion.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=405

of the 18th century saw a further revival of the Chishti order, 
reorganised by Shaikh Kalim Ullah (1650-1729) and his succes­
sors, notably Shah Fakruddin, who made Delhi the centre of his 
activities and gave a renewed momentum to Chishti organisation. Music and Society in North India 343 
Similar developments were evident in the Naqshbandi order 
under a series of remarkable leaders beginning with Shah 
Waliullah (1703-63), Mazhar Jan i Janan and Muhammad 
Badayuni. Satish Chandra (1986, pp 210-11) has suggested that 
there was a noticeable increase in the numbers ofUrs (birthday) 
celebrations of Sufi saints in Delhi, a development that is 
recorded by Dargah Quli Khan in his Muraqqa-e-Dehli, written 
during his stay (1737-41) in the middle of the reign of Muhammad 
Shah [Shekhar and Chenoy 1996]. Dargah Quli Khan was especially eloquent in his notices of 
Sufi leaders who spurned court patronage and led reclusive 
lives. What emerges from his account is the multi-layered 
musical culture of Delhi implicit in the contrast between the 
scenes of entertainment sponsored by the nobility and the 
wealthy, and the devotional pursuit of sublime experience 
practised in the Sufi Khanqahs (ibid, pp 36; 38-39, 45). Delhi's 
status as the cultural capital of music did not long survive 
Muhammad Shah (1719-48). By the early 19th century the 
musical situation was somewhat similar to that of the 15th 
century, when music flourished in a number of regional centres, 
each with its own ethos. Nevertheless, the symbolic significance 
of Delhi remained important even as the regional courts became 
prominent. All of them without exception were supplied with an 
outflow of musicians from the imperial capital. Contemporary observers tended to see the cultural efflores­
cence of Delhi in the early 18th century as symptomatic of a 
demoralised elite sinking into a quagmire of extreme hedonism. Dargah Quli Khan's account of the raunchy exploits of Delhi 
noblemen certainly warrants such a reading.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=406

evidently reflected a popular level of musical entertainment not 
to be mistaken with the high art music patronised by the Mughal 
court and cultivated by the KALA W ANTs. Dargah Quli Khan's 
Delhi had a very different atmosphere to that suggested in 
Nawab Faqirullah Saif Khan's Ragadarpana written sixty years 
earlier [Sarmadee 1996]. The contrast between the dignified, 
dhrupad dominated and darbar centric tone of the Ragadarpana

and the louche, even streetwise, ambience of the Muraqqa-i­
Dehli's performative world, despite the presence of Niamat 
Khan and other remarkable musicians, is striking. Muhammad 
Shah's reign is generally seen as the period in which dhrupad 
began to be displaced from its central position. This appears to 
have been the result of a decline in kalawant fortunes, mirroring 
the changes at the imperial centre, and a simultaneous 
resurgence of Sufism and the music associated with it. The first manifestation of trouble for the kalawants appears 
with Aurangzeb's famous proscription of music in 1667. Katherine 
Butler Brown's (2006) recently published article demonstrates 
how Aurangzeb's action was more in the nature of a withdrawal 
of patronage when the emperor, for personal reasons to do with 
grief and pious austerity, decided to abjure the enjoyment of 
music. However, the absence of substantial court employment 
lasted more than 30 years and precipitated a professional crisis 
among the elite musicians of the north, driving them to seek 
alternative patronage and to rethink professional/performative 
strategies. During this period an intense interest in music, 
reflected in a proliferation of musicological texts appears to 
have grown among the elite of Delhi that coincided with a 
resurgence of the Chishti and other liberal Sufi sects. It also saw 
kalawant musicians, most of whom were recent converts to 
Islam through the agency of Sufi saints, beginning to absorb the 
music and musical repertoire of the Qawwals in a more 
proactive manner.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=407

Aurangzeb's death in 1707 after a series of accessions and 
assassinations was followed by the bizarre episode ofjahandar 
Shah's rule with Lal Kunwar, his concubine and short-term wife 
( 1712-13) that constituted an extraordinary and well-docu­
mented episode in the convulsive decline of the Mughals. The 
courtesan Lal Kunwar was a descendant ofTansen according to 
contemporary sources [Irvine 1989; Chandra 1986] and became 
the favourite concubine of Aurangzeb's grandson Jahandar 
Shah, whom she twisted around her little finger, becoming his 
queen with the title of Imtiaz Mahal. Together they proceeded 
to scandalise the solid citizens of Delhi with a series of outra­
geous pranks - publicly bathing naked in the Suraj Kund in 
order to conceive a son and wandering about the city in 
drunken revels, mindless of imperial etiquette. Contemporary

chroniclers lamented the wilful promotion of her siblings, 
including Niamat Khan (later famous as 'Sadarang'), to high 
positions in the court and how her caprice frequently persuaded 
the emperor to act against his better judgment [Irvine 1989]. After a year of mismanagementjahandar Shah was assassinated 
and Lal Kun war pensioned off. This episode4 damaged 
relations between the Mughal administrative and military elite 
and the kalawant musical community, which was in any case 
held in low esteem by the orthodox Muslim community and 
the ulema. The next episode of transition was the successful entry of 
""cutting edge"" khyal into the court of Muhammad Shah. Niamat

cast Muhammad Shah in the role of a hero-lover. On discover­

request that his been-playing be given equal status with dhrupad 
singing [T J Singh 1995; Miner 1997]. This meant that he could, 
hereafter, sit and play solo been in the imperial presence. It also 
marked the entry of khyal, albeit via the zenana, into the domain 
of court music, an important step on its route to becoming the 
dominant secular form. EVOLUTION OF MUSIC IN NORTH INDIA: 
A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW Early orientalist historians conceived of Indian music as 
coming down in a continuous stream from Vedic times until the 
early medieval period when the music of Islamic societies, 
under the patronage of Muslim warlords, made a rude inroad 
into traditional 'marga' practice and corrupted its purity. Others 
later claimed that while some alien tunes, instruments and
346 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekry 
terminology were imported with the conquering culture, indig­
enous music was able to absorb these without losing its identity 
and that even those genres supposed to be derived from Persian 
models are in fact local forms. Neither of these views is 
satisfactory. While many elements in the collection of ragas, 
talas and practices that constitute classical Indian music have 
ancient origins in the Vedic and later Sanskritik culture, it is 
generally accepted that from about the 6th century a number of 
major decisive changes began to take place. Most significant 
was the growth of a repertoire of 'deshi' ragas and the gradual 
displacement of the 'grama-murchana' system of melodic clas­
sification [Prajananda 1981; Brihaspati 1934; Gautam 1980]. This laid the base for the shift to a universal tonic, 'sa', which 
characterises Hindustani music, and the need for a revised 
taxonomy of musical objects.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=409

characterises Hindustani music, and the need for a revised 
taxonomy of musical objects. Musical influence from the Islamic world must have been felt 
in India with the Arab invasion of Sind but from the 13th century 
a much richer melange of musical elements began to appear in 
north India in the wake of the Mongol depredations to the west. The arrival of Sufis from Persianised central Asia brought an 
influx of musicians with Turkoman and Persian instruments, 
tunes and song forms and a positive will to engage with Indian 
music and languages [Brihaspati 1934]. Hindi was considered by 
the Chishti Sheikhs to be capable of poetically expressing subtle 
metaphysical ideas more directly than Persian, and to be more 
suited to song. The Sufis were attracted to Yoga practices and, 
identifying with the metaphorical themes of bhakti, became 
enthusiastic patrons of Hindu music. This inclusive devotional 
sociability, and its preoccupation with music, lay at the core 
of the Hindustani ethos and lasted till the early 20th century. The pre-eminent musical personality in the early networks of 
cultural interaction was Amir Khusrau (1253-1325), the son of a 
Turkish nobleman and an Indian mother. He was equally 
famous as a ""luminous presence"" in a series of Delhi darbars 
(most notably that of Sultan Ala'uddin Khilji), and as the 
beloved disciple of one of the most revered and famous of all 
Sufi saints, Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia. Popular tradition credits 
Khusrau with the founding of the Hindustani musical tradition. He is believed to have mastered Indian music through the 
agency of Gopal Nayak (supposedly the greatest Indian musical
Music and Society in North India 347 
authority of the period) who, according to legend, came to 
Delhi, and appeared at the court of Ala'uddin Khilji (1296-
1316). The legend of Amir Khusrau's engagement with Gopal 
Nayak has a deep resonance in the imaginary reconciliation of 
the confrontation of indigenous Indian musical practice with the 
Islamic culture that was to dominate the subcontinent for 
centuries to follow [T J Singh 1995; Ansari 1975].",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=410

the confrontation of indigenous Indian musical practice with the 
Islamic culture that was to dominate the subcontinent for 
centuries to follow [T J Singh 1995; Ansari 1975]. Magical legend remembers Amir Khusrau as having taught 
his new syncretic music to two disciples, Samat and Nigar, the 
one deaf - the other dumb, at the command of his 'pir', 
Nizamuddin Auliya, to thereby manifest the compassionate 
power and grace of God. Legend says they established the 
lineage of the 'Qawwal Bachche' [Miner 1997; Roy Chowdhury 
undated], which remained closely connected to the Nizami 
Chishti Sufi silsila and ultimately left to the development of 19th 
century khyal. Nizamuddin Auliya's following, with its spiritual 
base at his dargah in Delhi, emerged as a major site of musical 
patronage, practice, accumulation and integration, to which 
musicians from all over India were attracted in the following 
centuries. The Chishti centres of Ajmer, Multan, Ajodhan, 
Delhi, Jaunpur, Bijapur and various others functioned as a 
geographical network for the circulation of musical as well as 
mystical, philosophical and literary culture. According to popular tradition, Amir Khusrau also invented a 
variety of musical genres like the 'q aul', 'q albana', ghazal, 'tarana', 
'naqsh-o-gul' and khyal, and instruments such as the Indian sitar 
and tabla [Singh 1995: 120-23]. These genres were actually 
derived from the conventional sequence of compositional forms 
in the contemporary Persian courts' musical repertoire [Farmer 
1957] which Khusrau integrated and naturalised through the use 
of indigenous languages and tunes. He participated in a larger 
inter-related Islamic musical world that spanned from Spain to 
India and the borders of China and is also credited with the 
introduction of a new system of classification based on the 
Persian 'maqam', that accommodated both Arabo-Persian tunes 
and the wealth of deshi ragas.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=411

Chishti Sufis in spreading their indigenised form of Islamic 
devotion in tandem with an inclusive musical culture meant that 
this sort of classification, which became known as the 'sansthan' 
or 'thaat' system in the north, was adopted even in southern

India where it was known as the 'melakarta' (Brihaspati 1934]. If he was in some way responsible for this development, it would 
have been quite consistent with the sort of intellectual engage­
ment with musical theory that was current among his Persian 
and Arab contemporaries. The musical culture that Khusrau's genius developed was a 
seamless synthesis of lndo-lslamic elements, musical and lin­
guistic, that fed into the devotional and court cultural practices 
of medieval India. However Persian and Turkomani music 
appears to have retained pride of place at court until the Mughal 
court registered a critical moment in the development of Indian 
music when Akbar's 'darbar' demonstrated a shift in imperial 
taste with its preferential patronage of the indigenous 'dhrupad'. The cultivation of classical Indian song-forms by pre-Mughal 
regional powers likejaunpur (1398-1480), Gwalior (1480-1520) 
and Bijapur (1489-1686) constituted rich inputs in terms of 
musicology and practice and contributed to a triumph of 
indigenous musical form at the Mughal centre [Wade 1998: 160-83]. The courts of Hussein Shirqi ofjaunpur5 and Man Singh Tamar 
of Gwalior were especially important in the evolution of 
""classical"" musical forms. Under Raja Man Singh dhrupad had 
acquired a cohesive form characterised by a four-part structure; 
the four 'tuks', 'sthai', 'antara', 'bhog' and 'abhog'. The form 
was perfected by a collaboration of leading indigenous 
musicians gathered together in Gwalior by Raja Man Singh 
(Miner 1997: 75].",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=412

elements, matured under the Imperial Mughal patronage. It 
drew from a cosmopolitan repertoire of musical forms of Arab, 
Persian and Khurasani music, the songs of the Qawwals qaul, 
qalbana, ghazal, tarana, etc, along with classical dhrupad, 
Hindu temple and devotional music and an endless variety of

with long histories of musical interaction and had been refined 
and re-composed in several major locations or nets of creative

various categories of musicians (ibid, pp 195, 197, 199-211) -
kalawants (dhrupadiahs), Dhadhis (especially associated with 
the epic song form 'kabbit'), Qawwals (specialists in qaul, tarana 
and khyal) goindahs and so on, were not static caste categories 
but changed over time. The dominance of the dhrupad in court 
did not preclude the circulation of other genres. The qawwali 
repertoire- the qaul, qalbana and tarana and so on were widely 
sung in the Sufi gatherings, and khyal, according to Allyn 
Miner ( 1997), the most widespread form of the time, was 
held in high musical regard in the 18th century (pp 845). In recording the processes of transformation of the khyal into 
the dominant genre it is easy to overlook the continuing 
importance of the dhrupad as the cornerstone of raga music. Many of the musicians who facilitated the success of the modern 
secular khyal were themselves dhrupadiahs and dhrupad re­
mained, conventionally, the dominant genre of most court 
music through to the early 20th century. Interacting with the 
Qawwal Bachches in a complex web of social relations, they 
applied the musical canons of the dhrupad in the articulation of 
the khyal, and maintained a special and close relationship with 
the Sufis, obtaining customary rights to perform at the dargah 
of Nizamuddin Aulia on occasions such as his Urs. In the
350 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
19th century, these families became the Agra, Khurja, Hapur, 
Secunderabad and Atrauli gharanas of khyal following the 
emergence of the Gwalior gharana. It is significant that leading 
khyaliahs of the late 19th and 20th centuries were by and large 
those dhrupadiahs who emerged as authentic sources of khyal 
teaching when the Qawwal Bachches, who had been the

415,"Interacting with the 
Qawwal Bachches in a complex web of social relations, they 
applied the musical canons of the dhrupad in the articulation of 
the khyal, and maintained a special and close relationship with 
the Sufis, obtaining customary rights to perform at the dargah 
of Nizamuddin Aulia on occasions such as his Urs. In the
350 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
19th century, these families became the Agra, Khurja, Hapur, 
Secunderabad and Atrauli gharanas of khyal following the 
emergence of the Gwalior gharana. It is significant that leading 
khyaliahs of the late 19th and 20th centuries were by and large 
those dhrupadiahs who emerged as authentic sources of khyal 
teaching when the Qawwal Bachches, who had been the 
traditional exponents of pre-modern khyal, had disappeared 
from the musical world. In instrumental music, as in vocal music, the advent of the 
Muslims brought about profound and far-reaching changes. Little is known with any certainty about the indigenous 
instrumental music current in north India at the time of 
Amir Khusrau. He mentions the 'alawan', a kind of been, as 
being the only instrument the (Hindu) kalawants could play 
well [Sarmadee 2004]. Stick zithers of various kinds (the been 
family including the 'kinnari', the 'jantar', the 'tuila' and the 
early been) appear to have been common throughout India 
and some sort of long necked lutes are attested to in 14th and 
15th century temple sculptures from the south and from 
Java, where quite an advanced form of been with two large 
gourds and frets is also commonly found. There is little or no 
evidence of short-necked lutes and the harps which abounded 
in ancient India. Muslim musicians brought with them Persian and Khurasani 
instruments; the 'chang' - a harp/zither, the 'rabab' and 'barbat', 
respectively skin-covered and wooden-topped lutes, the 'tambur' 
- the long-necked lute with wooden sound-board that would 
later be hybridised with the been to become the Indian 
tanpura. They had various forms of fiddles including a bowed 
rabab, a prototype of the early sarengi. Both cultures of 
course had flutes and oboes (shehnai, etc), but stringed 
instruments were more prominent in the art music of the 
Inda-Islamic world. In the domain of percussion the Muslims 
brought their 'duffs' and 'tabls' (and possibly the dholak), while 
the Hindus had their 'mridangam', 'ghatam' and others. There 
is no mention of the Persian 'setar' in the literature of the 
Muslim era but it would seem to have been a common instru­
ment in Kashmir from perhaps the 15th century, where along 
with the Afghani style of 'rabab', it was an important 
component of 'sufiana mausiqi' ensembles.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=415

was also common among Afghan warriors who played anthems 
and folk songs on it. This repertoire of musical instruments seems to have held 
sway from the 13th to the 17th century. Under the Mughals 
however, we see a growing Indianisation of court music repre­
sented in miniature painting in the depiction of musical instru­
ments [Wade 1998, pp 160-83]. Mian Tansen passed on to his 
descendants a dhrupad informed conception of playing the 
rabab and his son-in-law, the beenkar Mishri Singh, aka Naubat 
Khan, set a new course for the been. Having absorbed the 
instruments and methodological and melodic offerings that had 
immigrated into India from the Islamic world with the Sufis, the 
revitalised Hindustani music, with its own instruments, became 
the music of the Mughal darbar. Faqirullah's description [Sarmadee 1996: 191] of the 'soz 
khyal' invented by the Sufi Sheikh Baha'uddin Barnawi is an 
important pointer to the hybridity that characterised Hindustani 
music in Mughal India. Sheikh Baha'uddin, whose ancestors 
had been pirs to theJaunpur Sultans, was the pre-eminent Sufi 
musician and patron of the 'khusravi silsila' in the Delhi region 
in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. A versatile singer and 
rabab player, he devised a complex new stringed instrument, 
the soz khyal which enjoyed a certain vogue and presented a. 
performance of it played by one of his disciples, to Shah] ehan. It may well have survived as a venei:.ated curiosity and stimu­
lated later experimentation with iQstruments. The soz-khyal is 
the first instance we have of a deliberate invention of a new 
instrument; later we have the ""surbahar"" and the surchain

the beginning of a new conception of instrumental music that 
would lead to a range of hybrid instruments integrating dhrupad 
and khyal styles. The sitar, sarode, surbahar, sursringar, 
modern sarengi and even the tabla are all expressions of this 
process. (The sitar, first mentioned in the Muraqqa-i-Dehli, was
352 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Weekly 
found across north India, from the Punjab to Bengal, by the end 
of the 18th century.7 The Seniahs transformed it into a sort of 
been.) The musicological centrality of the Dhrupad and the 
acoustic primacy of the been 'ang', were essential to Niamat 
Khan's approach towards the perfection and refinement of the 
khyal. He revolutionised the faster tempo songs with a series of 
brilliant fusions of raga and rhythm and developed a slower and 
grander form of khyal, known as 'hara khyal'. This was set in 
longer cycles and performed in slow medium tempo that 
provided a leisurely framework in which a detailed 
improvisatory treatment of the raga became possible, while 
retaining the textual identity of the composition. Similarly, he 
enhanced the technique of the been, bridging the space be­
tween the Dhrupad, instrumental music and khyal. The descrip­
tion of his music in the Muraqqa makes it clear that he not only 
played the been superbly, but in a way that had not been heard 
before enrapturing and fascinating his listeners [Shekhar and 
Chenoy 1996: 75, 96]. Dargah Kuli Khan claims that there was 
never a beenkar like him before and indeed Niamat Khan is 
credited with having raised the Bin to the status of a solo 
instrument (ibid, pp 76-77). It is likely that Niamat Khan began a process of enlarging 
instruments, adding strings and widening the frets to permit 
more elaborate sliding tonal figures that marked the evolution 
of the been-sitar family of instruments over the subsequent two 
centuries. In any event, something in the way of a revolution in 
instrumental music was going on in his time and in his 
immediate family. His brother Khusrau Khan is described, in 
the Muraqqa-i-Dehli, as having a unique aptitude with all 
manner of musical instruments.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=417

surbahar and sursringar a deep sustained resonance that could

social setting when music spilt over into a number of regional

MUSIC IN SEARCH OF NEW PATRONS With the invasion of Nadir Shah in 1739, the crisis ofMughal 
decline became all too clear. Delhi was subjected to unprece­
dented violence and the moral bankruptcy of the Mughal court 
lay exposed. The effects of political change on Delhi's tradi­
tional culture were severe. By 1761, when the fateful clash 
between the Marathas and Afghans had been decided on the 
plains of Panipat, the fate of the emperor was in the hands of self­
aggrandising nobles. Delhi became an empty city, desolate and 
bankrupt and in no condition to sustain the older cultural fabric. Raiding armies produced a state of intermittent siege and Delhi 
was, as the poet Mir observed, ""little more than a wilderness, 
which every six months was laid desolate afresh"" [Russel and 
Alam 1968: 35]. Mir, like so many artists, left Delhi in search of 
new patrons. While acknowledging Delhi as the ultimate arbiter 
of standards, they realised that the city was no longer in a 
position to sustain them.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=418

musicians left Delhi for the burgeoning regional courts, the most 
notable being Lucknow in the independent kingdom of Awadh, 
which under Asaf ud daulah's reign (1775-1797) ""began to 
surpass even that of the emperor in Delhi"" in wealth and 
magnificence. The N awabs Shujadaulah ( 17 54-7 5) and Asaf ud 
daulah patronised the arts in a big way, attracting prominent 
Delhi artists such as Jani and Ghulam Rasul (khyal singers) and 
the celebrated instrumentalists Chajju Khan andjivan Khan -
dhrupadiahs and rababiahs. All manner of performers flocked 
to Lucknow and the court soon became a celebrated centre of 
musical entertainment [Miner 1997: 97].8 Another important 
destination was Jaipur, with which the enigmatic composer 
'Manarang', famous for his khyals and 'dadras' in the dhrupad 
manner, was associated in this period. The founder of 
the kingdom, Sawai Jaisingh (1727-1743) was favourably dis­
posed to music and scholarship and by the late 19th century its 
'gunijankhana' boasted a host of great musicians, especially

instrumentalists. Gwalior emerged as an outstanding centre for 
khyal after its ru\er Daulat Rao Sindhia (1794-1827) attached 
the vocalists Bade Muhammad Khan and Qadir Baqsh and 
his sons Haddu and Hassu Khan to the court [Wade 1985,

and its patronage held for the cultural politics and profile of

poetry, ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous, becomes 
easier to comprehend. Other sites of patronage, especially for instrumental music,

son, Ali Raza, spent time in Patna after the Mutiny [Miner 1997:

narratives we have of the musicians on the move, is that an 
extremely mobile and peripatetic community deployed connec­
tions of kin, patronage and skill to find a niche in courtly culture 
and presumably in Sufi musical circles as well. The relocation of music hardly interfered with the experi­
menting tendency that had been set in motion. Developments 
in vocal and instrumental music suggest that regional centres 
like Rohilkhand and Lucknow sustained a series of important 
artistic innovations. Moreover Delhi remained a centre for the 
sitar and Masit Khan ( 17 50-1820), a celebrated beenkar who is 
especially important for his slow-tempo sitar compositions, 
is thought to have resided there9 (ibid, pp 93-94). The capital

(Sleeman 1858] dominated by courtesans, that is in stark 
contrast to the high art music associated with the Mughal 
court. While this representation was biased and informed by 
British imperial designs on the court of Lucknow, it is important 
to consider how the shift in the spatial relocation of music, 
disconnected from its religious and imperial social context, 
to the 'kotahs' of Lucknow and the cantonments of Delhi, 
transformed the content of Indian music between the late 
18th and mid-19th century. The Mutiny of 1857 and its after­
math put a seal to the changes and north Indian music had, to 
eventually, adapt to an even more profound and disruptive 
series of transitions through the phases of metropolitan and 
cosmopolitan modernity. BEFORE AND AFTER 1HE MUTINY: 
THE EMERGENCE OF GHARANAS AND A NEW SETTING 
FOR HINDUSTAN! MUSIC The emergence of the gharanas around the end of the 19th 
century reflected the complexities of the sociological transition and 
transformation that music underwent before and after the Mutiny, 
culminating in the shift of the centre of Hindustani musical culture 
from central north India to the metropolitan centres of Calcutta 
and Bombay. Moving between various courts, musicians were 
often at loggerheads, competing for patronage and reluctant to 
share their musical resources outside their family circle. The term
356 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week(y 
gharana, derived from 'ghar' referred both to a legitimate line of 
transmission and its artistic content and character. The traceable line of the Gwalior gayaki, which appears to 
have been the reference point from which other gharanas were 
defined, begins with the Qawwal Bachche singer Ghulam 
Rasool, son of Taj Khan Qawwal [mentioned in the Muraqqa, 
Shekhar and Chenoy 1996:78] and a follower of Sadarang's 
gayaki (it is quite likely that he was a direct student of Sadarang). Ghulam Rasool moved between Delhi and Lucknow and 
performed in the court of Asafudaula (1775-97). His widowed 
sister had two talented sons known as Shakkar and Makkhan 
whom she persuaded Ghulam Rasool to teach. 10 The brothers 
developed a rivalry. Shakkar's son, Bade Muhammad Khan 
emerged as a singer of extraordinary, virtuosic abilities and was 
appointed as a musician in the court of Gwalior.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=421

Baqsh had three sons Haddu, Hassu and Nathu Khan who were 
the founders of the Gwalior gharana.11 A dramatic foundation 
legend of the gharana reveals the interplay of royal favouritism 
with familial jealousy. According to legend Bade Mohammad 
Khan was frightened and jealous of Qadir Baqsh and poisoned 
him. Moreover, he would not permit the young Haddu and 
Hassu to even hear his music. When Daulat Rao Sindhia, who 
was the patron of Bade Mohammad Khan, died, his sonjankoji 
Rao Sindhia persuaded their grandfather, the ageing Pir Baqsh 
to teach Haddu and Hassu so they could avenge their father's 
death and become the pre-eminent singers of the Gwalior 
darbar. In an episode redolent of Amir Khusrau's encounter 
with Gopal Nayak, Pir Baqsh persuadedJankoji that in order to 
defeat Bade Mohammed Khan in musical combat, they should 
first secretly hear him perform. True to archetype they hid 
beneath the throne, heard Bade Muhammad's music and 
were able to master the intricate 'tanas' for which he was 
famous. In a competition arranged by RajaJankoji Rao, Bade 
Mohammed Khan was duly defeated by his junior cousins. In 
a huff he left Gwalior and lived out his days in the court of 
Rewa. He did however have his revenge when in another 
round of competition he challenged Haddu Khan with a 
'kharak bijli tana' (a strong lightning tana). Trying to duplicate

these ferocious patterns, the unfortunate Haddu Khan broke 
a rib, punctured his lung and died [Wade 1985, pp 40;

the die was cast. Haddu and Hassu and their brother Natthan

day, eventually became the point of reference for numerous

of the Gwalior gharana and extolled their teachers as the true

studied with Tanras Khan (Qawwal Bachche) of Delhi, Haddu

Khan. The Agra gharana locates its beginning as khyalias with 
Gagge Khuda Baksh (1800-60) who turned to Natthan Khan of 
the Gwalior Qawwal Bachche for vocal training and ended up 
acquiring an impressive repertoire of his khyal ban dishes [Singh 
1995: 273-80, 293-95, 299-301]. There is a marked paucity of 
information about gharanas like Khurja and Hapur. They were 
dhrupadjkalawant lines with Qawwal Bachche connections, but 
when and how they took up khyal is not clear. Kubdje 
Mohammad Baksh of Hapur (late 18th century 
early 19th 
century) was the guru of Mian Achpal, who was in turn the guru 
of Tanras Khan, the great khyaliah of Bahadur Shah Zafar's 
Delhi durbar. The Khurja musicians12 had some connections 
with Rampur in the 18th century, and possibly with Feroze Khan 
'Adarang', who had relocated from Delhi to Rampur around the 
1760s. Khurja's greatest exponent, who became a musician of 
all India repute was Mian Zahur Baksh 'Ramdas', a brilliant 
singer-composer who travelled and taught widely. We have an 
account of him teaching esoteric aspects of voice production 
and breath control to the important south Indian musician, 
Ghanam Krishna Iyer. 13 Thus, virtually all the existing lineages 
of khyal registered a significant initiation through some 
connection with the Qawwal Bachche line. In reflecting on the 19th century story of musical dissemina­

to the faster, more rhythmic, tarana and 'chhote' khyal, 
Masit Khan produced a form of playing that incorporated the 
dignified virtues of Sadaranga's bada khyals. A branch of 
Seniah sitar playing settled inJaipur, where Rahim Sen and his 
son Amrit Sen (born 1814), the greatest sitarist of the 19th 
century, attained unmatched refinement and virtuosity in han­
dling the instrument. Masit Khan's son Umrao Khan - the premier beenkar of his 
time - became one of the great teachers of the 19th century, and 
several lines of sarodiahs and sitarists had their initial Seni 
'talim' from him, including Ghulam Ali Bandegi (the ancestor 
of Hafiz Ali Khan and his son, the famous contemporary 
sarodiah Amjad Ali) and Ina yet Khan, the doyen of Shahjehanpur 
gharana. The professional locations of both father and son are 
uncertain, but they moved around a lot in a very disturbed 
world. Around 1825 Umrao Khan devised a giant sitar for his 
shagird, Ghulam Muhammad, that would play alaap like the 
been, and soon developed into a magnificent instrument, the 
surbahar, which was taken up by many musicians including 
Imdad Khan, the great grandfather of the 20th century sitar 
maestro Vilayet Khan. Umrao Khan's son Amir Khan, was

Music and Society in North India 359 
extremely popular among Pathans ofRohilkhand and Rampur, 
used gut strings over a wooden fingerbo.ard with gut frets tied 
around. It had a long and narrow skin covered drum and was 
carved from light mulberry wood. Sharing common features 
with the Indian rabab, its tone was weaker and lacked ""sustain"" 
(a voice-like continuity of sound after a stroke on the string), 
though this was partly compensated for by a complement of 
sympathetic strings that added sweetness/mood to its sound. Its 
evolution,. into an instrument that could emulate qualities of the 
been and the Indian rabab, began when the dhrupad rabab 
playing descendents of Tansen's son Bilas Khan invented the 
sursringar, around the same time as the surbahar appe.ared. Jafar Khan and Piya Khan were the leading rababiahs of the 
early 19th century. During a monsoon in Benaras, Jafar Khan 
found that his rabab could not answer the music of his cousin 
Nirmal Shah's been, because the goatskin soundboard had 
become limp in the humidity. He took time off and made a 
rabab with a wooden top to which he fitted a steel fingerboard, 
steel strings and a been-like 'jovari' bridge14 and with this 
innovation, he was able to compete effectively with the been. The Sursringar, enjoyed a vogue throughout the 19th century, 
and its steel plate and metal strings were the technological basis 
for the modern Sarod. Pyar Khan's son Basat Khan, a prominent 
ustad in the court of N awab W ajid Ali Shah, relocated with him 
to Calcutta in 1856, just before the Mutiny. Accompanying 
Basat Khan was his shagird, the Afghan sarodiah Niamatullah 
Khan, who is thought to have been the first to fix a steel plate 
and metal strings on his Afghani rabab (also called a sarode) at 
the behest of his ustad. He probably did this around 1840, or 
perhaps earlier, and other sarodiahs were soon doing the same. This new instrument, like the transformed sitar, adapted over 
time with the evolving music.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=425

19th centuries did not entirely undermine the patronage basis 
of Hindustani music, even if it resulted in its spatial dispersion. 360 
1857: Essays from Economic and Political Week(>, As musicians moved out from Delhi in search of support, 
they found themselves interacting with provincial, local cul­
tures. The regional rulers looked back to Mughal Delhi for a 
cultural model and sought out musicians who embodied its 
accomplishments and traditions and their kingdoms collectively 
produced a fresh field of circulation for musicians and for 
musical creativity. This is illustrated by the case of the rabab­
playing sarodiahs in Rampur forming connections with 
Senia musicians; of the Senia sitarists finding a conducive 
reception in Rajput courts where the been had a long tradition; 
and of Gwalior, where the khyal found a courtly location from 
which it spread just as the dhrupad had 300 years before. In 
Lucknow Mian Shori, aka Jani Rasool took 'tappa' to new 
heights (late 18th century); Ghulam Raza developed a bright, 
light classical genre of sitar gats {mid 19th century) and khyal­
like thumris were developed for Kathak dance. Benaras also 
became an important centre for dhrupad and instrumental 
music in the late 18th century and a number of other, 
smaller courts were important in the circulation of musicians 
and ideas. Rewa, whose Rajas were themselves musicians 
and patrons; Banda, the home of Kudau Singh'5 [Singh 1997: 
300] the great doyen of Pakhawaj, and of the surbahar 
player Ghulam Muhammad; Betiah, whose Rajas were 
'Kali bhaktas' and composers of dhrupads in her honour were 
other centres. In Delhi the tabla evolved and entered the 
classical fold as an accompaniment to khyal and was later 
elaborated in various local styles with special preoccupations -
dance in Lucknow and slow 'purab ang' thumri in Benaras. Other principalities that participated in this wave of patronage 
and interaction included Bishnupur, Darbhanga, Alwar, 
Jhajhar, Baroda, Indore Thaunk, Patiala, the Nepal of the 
Ranas and so on.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=426

musicological talim and penchant for creative innovation of 
the Seniahs at the cutting edge. This post-Mughal circulation 
precipitated contemporary classical music that then drifted to 
the metropolises. How did the Mutiny of 1857 transform the musical scene? There is no doubt that it sounded the final death knell for 
Mughal Delhi and ushered in far-reaching changes. For the 
next 90 years of British rule, the 'sarkar' did not extend any
Mu.sic and Society in North India 361 
significant patronage to traditional music. Even before the 
cataclysmic event, music as part of an older court culture had 
dispersed to other centres. Those that sided with the Company 
in their encounter with the rebels emerged, ironically enough, 
as principal centres of classical music in the decades to follow. In the case of Awadh, which was annexed in 1856, the relocation 
of the N awab with his retinue of ustads and entertainers proved 
fortuitous in providing Calcutta with an -important cultural and 
artistic resource that the city's bhadralok and new middle class 
would consume and nurture. The Mutiny has been seen as a watershed in the history of 
India. For the greater part of the country, it marked the 
moment of rupture with a pre-modern past and the inaugura­
tion of the forces of modernisation, even if the British crown 
preferred to maintain a low profile in matters of religious 
and social reform. While admittedly, the moment of reckoning 
had already occurred in regions like Bengal, which by 1857 
had embraced and responded to the benefits and challenges 
of western education, the Mutiny made this transition 
unequivocal for the rest of the country. For music, the rupture 
with an earlier political and moral economy was not 
insignificant.",1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly$@$20250528_151036/1857_Essay_from_economics_and_political_weekly.pdf#page=427

the essential features of North Indian classical music had 
already been accumulated and expanded in the century of 
decline and transition, the changing context of patronage 
especially as music came under the purview of a modernising 
elite in cities and courts alike, exercised a profound impact on 
the social constituency of the tradition. As music dispersed 
and musicians spread outside their customary locations, 
they found it critical to invoke claims of authenticity for 
their music and the family they represented. A tangible mani­
festation of this process was in the emergence of gharanas 
or styles, all of which were intertwined with older webs of 
sociability based on Qawwal Bachhe teaching lines and kalawant 
families. At the same time, the increasing interest of the middle 
class in music was producing a new sociology of performance 
and pedagogy. Muslim ustads, hereafter, had to negotiate with 
an ""orientalised"" nationalism that privileged a constructed 
Hindu past and modern notions of institutional music 
education [Bakhle 2005). 362

3 Most of the kalawants appear to have converted to Islam during the period 
of the Great Mughals and to have had close connections with the Chistis. The popularity of khyal appears to have grown considerably with the 
influence of Ba'hauddin Bamawi and the resurgence of Chisti influence. Although the kalawants sang dhrupad professionally, there is evidence 
that they participated in the musical activity of the dargahs. Taj Khan 
Qawwal's sons (Muraqqa-e-Dehli, p 78), Ghulam Rasool and Jani, sang the 
gayaki of Niamat Khan. See Thakur J aideva Singh ( 1995), p 228. 4 Katherine Butler Brown suggests that this episode cemented a decline in 
kalawant fortunes from which they never really recovered. 5 See foreword in Tarjuma I Manakutuhala and Risa/a I Ragadarpana by 
Faqirullah edited and annotated by Shahab Sarmadee; Appendices, p 234. 6 Katherine Butler Brown's thesis on the emergence of the khyal documents 
the importance ofjaunpur and of Bahauddin Bamavi's contributions. 7 The KashmirijPersian sehtar seems to have replaced the longer slimmer 
tambur in the 18th century as the common lute, while the Tambur had 
transmogrified to become the tanpura - a sophisticated drone to accom­
pany singers. 8 Ghulam Rasul and Jani were Lucknow's first khyal singers; the Muraqqa 
mentions them as prominent qawwal singers of Delhi. One may surmise 
that their lives spanned the century of transition. 9 The 'gat toda' is explained in detail by Miner. Masit Khan is credited for 
adopting actual dhrupad compositions for melodies to use in his gats. 10 Some sources suggest that Shakkar Khan was the son-in-law of Ghulam 
Rasool. 11 There are several versions of this story. Here, an attempt has been made
