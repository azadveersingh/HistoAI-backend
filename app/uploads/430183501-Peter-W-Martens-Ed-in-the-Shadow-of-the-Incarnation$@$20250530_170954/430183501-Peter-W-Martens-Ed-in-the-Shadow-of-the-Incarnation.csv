Introduction
Peter W. Martens
T
he essays in this volume are offered in warm gratitude to Brian E. 
Daley, S.J. They serve, to be sure, as only a small expression of 
thanks from a handful of the many who count themselves as Brian’s 
friends. They are centered on the topic of Jesus Christ in the early 
church and were commissioned on the occasion of our honoree’s sixty-
ﬁ fth birthday. I cannot introduce Brian Daley more succinctly or more faithfully 
than by describing him as a Jesuit priest. It is the Jesuit way of life that 
has ordered and shaped the rest of his life, including his vocation as a 
scholar. Brian entered the Society of Jesus in 1964, shortly after taking 
his B.A., Literae Humaniores from Oxford University. Long before he 
joined the Jesuits, however, the Society had already begun to mold 
him. Brian attended a Jesuit high school, St. Peter’s Preparatory School 
in New Jersey, and he earned his ﬁ rst college degree from another 
Jesuit institution, Fordham University (B.A. in Classics). After joining 
the Society, much of Brian’s early theological education transpired at 
the Jesuit Hochschule, Sankt Georgen (Frankfurt, Germany), where he 
served as the research assistant to Aloys Grillmeier, S.J. Brian would
2 Peter W. Martens
 return to Oxford, where he was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy for 
his thesis on Leontius of Byzantium. While at Oxford he lived at Cam-
pion Hall, a private house owned and run by the Jesuits. Much of Brian’s academic service and scholarship has been woven 
into the fabric of major Jesuit institutions. After graduating from Ox-
ford he taught for eighteen years at the Weston Jesuit School of The-
ology, one of two Jesuit seminaries in the United States. Over the years 
Brian has also served as a trustee at Le Moyne College, Boston College, 
and Fordham, and served as a member on the board of directors at 
Georgetown University. He was also an acting dean at Weston. He has 
been a member of the editorial boards of the series Studies in Jesuit 
Spiritu ality and of Communio: International Theological Review, and is 
an editor for  Traditio. His Ignatian identity has also been expressed in 
the larger ecclesiastical community, where his dedication to reconcili-
ation and ecumenism, integral to his understanding of Jesuit ministry, 
is evident. One of Brian’s enduring achievements is his contribution to 
 ecumenical dialogue.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=4

the larger ecclesiastical community, where his dedication to reconcili-
ation and ecumenism, integral to his understanding of Jesuit ministry, 
is evident. One of Brian’s enduring achievements is his contribution to 
 ecumenical dialogue. Most notably, he has faithfully served for nearly 
twenty-ﬁ ve years as a member of the Orthodox-Roman Catholic Con-
sultation, a bilateral dialogue sponsored by Orthodox and Roman Ca-
tholic bishops of the United States. Brian’s Jesuit commitments overﬂ ow into the classroom and print. Perhaps without peer in his generation, Brian has cultivated a lifelong 
passion for the Christology of the early church. This is certainly not his 
only interest—the span of topics that he has tackled in print is remark-
able, ranging from Origen’s scriptural interpretation to the debates sur-
rounding the Filioque, from early Christian eschatology to late medieval 
iconography of Mary, from the relationship between Boethius and Byz-
antine scholasticism to Ignatian spirituality, from the episcopacy in the 
early church to commentary on the Catholic catechism—the list goes 
on. And none of this exhausts the incredible breadth of topics about 
which Brian can effortlessly converse, which is ﬁ tting for someone who 
has taken to heart the Ignatian ideal of a rich, cultural humanism. Nev-
ertheless, Jesus Christ in the early church is Brian’s central academic 
passion. At Sankt Georgen he had the privilege of studying under the 
eminent scholar of patristic Christology, Aloys Grillmeier, and several 
years later at Oxford, he was awarded his D.Phil. for his thesis on 
 Leontius of Byzantium, a theologian who played an integral role in the
Introduction 3
post-Chalcedonian debates about the person of Christ. Whether in ar-
ticles, translations, lectureships, books, or courses offered, Brian has 
continuously held before his own eyes, as well as those of his peers and 
students, the Christ who was contemplated, loved, and followed by 
early Christians. I 
have entitled this volume “In the Shadow of the Incarnation.” The
 phrase is inspired by a stirring passage in Origen’s On First Principles 
where the Alexandrian turns his treatise with “deepest amazement” to-
ward the mystery of the incarnation and, in particular, to Jesus’ soul 
(Princ. 2.6.1).",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=5

 phrase is inspired by a stirring passage in Origen’s On First Principles 
where the Alexandrian turns his treatise with “deepest amazement” to-
ward the mystery of the incarnation and, in particular, to Jesus’ soul 
(Princ. 2.6.1). In Origen’s cosmic vision, this soul was unique among all 
other primordial souls since it clung with such an indissoluble love to 
the Son, Word, and Wisdom of God who had created it that, having re-
ceived so fully of this Son, this soul became “one spirit” with it and 
could ﬁ ttingly be called “the Son of God.” Origen then turns toward his 
reader with a pastoral exhortation. Surely it does not fall to the soul of 
Jesus alone to become, by imitation, “one spirit” with God’s Word, Wis-
dom, and Truth. After all, it was Paul who also wrote: “he who is joined 
to the Lord is one spirit” (1 Cor 6:17) (Princ. 2.6.3). As the soul of Jesus 
practiced a loving union with God’s Word and Wisdom, so too ought 
Origen’s readers to turn their souls in love toward the pioneer of their 
salvation. With these two loves in mind, Origen recollects the poetic lines ut-
tered by the prophet Jeremiah: “The breath of our countenance is Christ 
the Lord, of whom we said that we shall live under his shadow among 
the nations” (Lam 4:20). The depiction of Christ as a “shadow” rouses 
Origen’s exegetical imagination. Shadows, he notes, are inseparable 
from their bodies and unswervingly mimic their movements and ges-
tures. This is perhaps what the prophet had in mind when he was lik-
ening Christ to a “shadow”—the prophet was alluding to the action of 
Christ’s soul that was inseparably attached to the Word. And in the 
verse cited above, Jeremiah also speaks of Christ’s followers living 
“under his shadow among the nations.” Jesus’ disciples, Origen con-
cludes, live under his shadow to the extent that they “imitate that soul 
through faith and so reach salvation” (Princ. 2.6.7).",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=6

our volume well on several levels. It is inspired by the pen of one of the
4 Peter W. Martens
early church’s most distinguished theologians, and it also refers back to 
these theologians, who themselves sought to live under Christ’s shadow 
among the nations. The title also suggests more speciﬁ cally the theme 
of this book: Jesus Christ as he was perceived through the eyes and 
hearts of the early church’s scholars. These were theologians, after all, 
who were convinced that to live under the shadow of Christ also meant 
to reﬂ ect with unwavering gaze upon Christ. The title also points beyond this book to our honoree. Brian Daley 
has not only studied Jesus Christ in the early church, he has also sought 
to live “in the shadow of the incarnation.” Brian’s students, colleagues, 
and friends know him not only as a teacher of Christ but also as a dis-
ciple of Christ. Formed by Ignatius of Loyola’s Spiritual Exercises, 
whose sole objective is to help a person know and follow Christ more 
intimately, Brian lives in a religious community founded as the “Com-
pany of Jesus.” In the Notre Dame community, his academic home 
since 1996, he presides regularly at Eucharist in the basilica. Brian gives 
his time generously to the cura personalis of students, faculty, and ad-
ministration and fosters a warm relationship with his graduate stu-
dents. Some of my best memories in the doctoral program at Notre 
Dame come from our Monday evening gatherings at a local brewing 
company. There Brian reserved a large corner booth and read through 
a Greek text from the early church with a cluster of diligent graduate 
students (much to the amusement of the restaurant staff). Brian’s care 
for his students extends to his home as well. His hospitality and culi-
nary skills are repeatedly displayed for students and faculty at the aptly-
named “De Lubac House,” the Jesuit residence off campus named in 
honor of the proliﬁ c Jesuit scholar and student of the early church, 
Henri de Lubac.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=7

casions as well), invitations to the De Lubac House are held in high 
 regard. The Ignatian heritage has left an indelible mark upon Brian’s life. Within the classroom, his voice is refreshingly free of ironic detach-
ment or abrasive polemic. It is rare, indeed, to ﬁ nd someone today who 
is willing to hold a conversation with the theologians of the early church 
under the conviction that they are our equals, worthy of being studied 
and heard on their own terms, worthy of informing and forming us, 
worthy of even having, on occasion, the last word. While incessant de-
Introduction 5
mands are placed upon Brian outside the classroom, he generously 
makes himself available to those who request his help and counsel. De-
spite towering erudition, Brian remains refreshingly unassuming, 
good-humored, and humble. And while he holds strong convictions, he 
speaks the truth in love. As others will testify, it is not selﬁ sh ambition 
that drives him, but rather his ever-growing love for Jesus Christ. So, if Brian is in any way apprehensive about being honored with 
this volume, my suspicion is that this unease emerges from a conviction, 
which he has both taught and lived: the servant cannot be greater than 
his Master. But even servants can be thanked. Nor is there anything in-
congruous, in speaking of this Master, as this book will do, to acknowl-
edge those who have served him well, whether they are the theologians 
of the early church or our honoree. If there is even the slightest suspi-
cion that this book might signal the twilight of Brian’s scholarly career, 
then let us clearly announce that this volume is simply a timely expres-
sion of thanks and encouragement to our teacher, colleague, and, above 
all, friend. Ad multos annos! I

9,"If there is even the slightest suspi-
cion that this book might signal the twilight of Brian’s scholarly career, 
then let us clearly announce that this volume is simply a timely expres-
sion of thanks and encouragement to our teacher, colleague, and, above

have arranged the essays that follow in chronological order. The 
 volume opens with D. Jeffrey Bingham’s examination of the role 
that apocalyptic motifs and the book of Revelation played in the Letter 
to the Churches of Lyons and Vienne. The Letter was written shortly after 
the persecution of Christians in Lyons in 177 and is preserved by Euse-
bius in his Ecclesiastical History (5.1.3–5.3.3). Bingham demonstrates 
that the martyr accounts in the Letter give voice to a wide range of 
apocalyptic motifs and draw extensively upon themes voiced in John’s 
Apocalypse. From these apocalyptic perspectives on the martyrs’ deaths 
arises a Christology that depicts the martyrs as followers of Christ the 
“Lamb” (Rev 14:4). Bingham argues further that the Letter portrays 
Christ the Lamb and his martyr-followers as sacriﬁ cial victims, whose 
self- offerings had a militaristic tenor: the martyrs shared in Christ’s 
own combat against the Adversary, a combat that was apologetic and 
revelatory as Christ’s martyrs demonstrated the solidity of their faith to 
their onlookers. Khaled Anatolios ushers us into the early fourth century with his 
gentle critique of Karl Rahner’s critical assessment of “classical Chris-
tology.” Rahner contended that patristic Christology was overly preoc-
cupied with ontological and not functional concerns, that is, it offered a
6 Peter W. Martens
Christology concerned with Christ’s “nature” and “person” but insufﬁ -
ciently attentive to the salviﬁ c work of Christ in his life, death, and res-
urrection pro nobis. With Athanasius’s On the Incarnation in mind, 
Anatolios shows that in many ways this early theologian’s exposition of 
“classical Christology” was more “functional” than even Rahner might 
have suspected. Anatolios concludes by taking up Rahner’s recommen-
dation to translate the basic insights of Athanasius’s Christology into 
simple statements that have a straightforward relevance to the experi-
ence of the Christian faith today. The next two essays explore the “Athanasius of the West,” Hilary 
of Poitiers. Michael C. McCarthy, S.J., offers an eloquent piece on Hil-
ary’s interpretation of the Psalms. McCarthy reminds us that ancient 
interpreters of the Psalms, Hilary included, viewed them as the Word 
of God operating at a particular moment in the history of the church 
and the life of the individual Christian. For Hilary, McCarthy con-
tends, the Psalms did not simply provide locutions for healing present 
maladies but also offered a future orientation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=9

nar rative wherein Hilary interpreted the Psalms in his Tractatus super 
 Psalmos. Carl L. Beckwith, in his essay on Hilary of Poitiers, argues against 
the school of scholarship that maintains Hilary was a Docetist because 
he claimed that Christ suffered without pain. Beckwith contends that 
when we read Hilary’s comments on Christ’s suffering in the larger 
context of his De Trinitate, bearing in mind both his philosophical com-
mitment to Stoic moral psychology and his theological adversaries, his 
Christology not only escapes suspicion but also emerges as a signiﬁ cant 
contribution to fourth-century patristic thought. We return to the Greek world with Christopher A. Beeley’s essay 
on Gregory of Nazianzus. Beeley asserts that Gregory’s doctrine of 
Christ is wrongly summarized in the standard accounts as “dualist.” Beeley argues for the predominantly unitive character of Gregory’s 
Christology by offering a sensitive examination of whether biblical ref-
erences to Christ’s actions refer to one or two acting subjects, and by 
 exploring the ramiﬁ cations of a purported dualist Christology for Greg-
Introduction 7
ory’s own understanding of salvation and the Christian life. Beeley also 
raises (and dismisses) the claim that Gregory of Nazianzus was in any 
way fundamentally anti-Apollinarian. Eustathius of Antioch, an early opponent of Arius, receives con-
siderable attention in Kelley McCarthy Spoerl’s essay. Spoerl offers a 
detailed examination of the trinitarian and christological features of 
Eustathius of Antioch’s thought and compares his views with those of 
another early opponent of Arius, Marcellus of Ancyra. Spoerl high-
lights the kinship between these two pro-Nicene theologians, as well as 
their notable differences. She concludes by suggesting that their trini-
tarian and christological afﬁ nities provide clues to the emergence of 
Apollinarius’s Christology, a later and very different Christology from 
within the same pro-Nicene coalition. The next four essays touch on various facets of Augustine’s Chris-
tology. Basil Studer compares Origen and Augustine on the theme of 
loving Christ, emphasizing the love and friendship that exists between 
believers and Christ. Studer focuses in particular on the practice of the-

Origen and Augustine, the discipline of theology was an exercise prac-
ticed in the presence of Christ and in dependence on him as the theolo-
gian quested after the vision of God. Studer refers in his essay to a paper delivered by the Archbishop of 
Canterbury, Rowan Williams, at an International Patristics Conference 
(Oxford, 2003), which Williams has also contributed to this volume. Williams offers an insightful account of the persona of Jesus Christ in 
Augustine’s major writings. For Augustine, the divine sapientia is ﬁ rst 
and foremost the joyful contemplation of God by God, but in so doing, 
this sapientia also realizes itself as caritas, a radically disinterested love 
that seeks the fruition of others in the same joy it knows. In Jesus 
Christ, then, we see the person of divine Wisdom-in-action, the hu-
mility of identiﬁ cation with the created order through the incarnation, 
Wisdom engaging with what is not by nature God so as to incorporate 
it into the divine life and make it capable of seeing what Wisdom sees. This humility is precisely what the created order needs, since our pride-
ful self-assertion is the root of our alienation from God, and only a hu-
mility that reﬂ ects Wisdom’s caritas can again reconcile us with God

and one another. The incarnate Christ, so Williams argues, with J.-M. 
Le Blond, serves as our path to and the form of the transﬁ guring and 
participatory knowledge of God for Augustine. However, the concept 
of Christ as sapientia is linked as much to spirituality as it is to Chris-
tology proper. Williams proposes that the rhetoric of Augustine’s Chris-
tology sounds “Cyrilline” or unitive (as opposed to Antiochene, where 
the concern is to distribute the dicta of Jesus between the Word and the 
human individual Jesus) because of Augustine’s own sense of the abso-
lute dependence of the incarnate one’s human speech on the single act 
of divine Wisdom. There is no dialogue of resistance or submission be-
tween Jesus and the Word, as there is between the Word and other 
human beings. Rather, the incarnation is the act of divine self-offering 
that concretely animates the soul-body humanity of Christ.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=11

earthly life of the incarnate Son is a speaking or acting in the person of 
divine Wisdom, who is freely engaged in the world of historical suffer-
ing and struggle. Williams’s essay has clear links to the two that follow it. Lewis 
Ayres examines Augustine’s Letter 137, in which for the ﬁ rst time the 
Bishop of Hippo uses the noun persona to describe Christ (“uniting both 
natures in the unity of his person”) and likens the union between the 
two natures in Christ to the union of soul and body in the human being. Ayres argues that questions about the doctrine of the incarnation are 
for Augustine inseparable from questions about the more basic theo-
logical context in which Christian doctrine is explored and questioned. In particular, Augustine encourages his readers to cultivate a special 
practice of thought and contemplation as they consider the constitution 
of Christ’s person, a practice shaped by how creation exists within God’s 
presence and ought to exhibit the humility modeled by the incarnate 
Christ. The ensuing contemplation of Christ’s person is less concerned 
with making the union of the natures comprehensible than it is with 
deﬁ ning and reﬂ ecting upon the incomprehensibility of this union. David R. Maxwell continues an examination of Augustine’s notion 
of Christ’s persona by turning to the Scythian monks’ reception, or lack 
thereof, of Augustine’s Christology as it was voiced in his De Trinitate. Why did the theologians of the Theopaschite controversy in the sixth 
century, who in most regards were ardent Augustinians, fail to draw on 
Augustine in their Christology? Maxwell contends that when Augus-

McGuckin, and Andrew Louth. O’Keefe examines an overlooked facet 
of Cyril of Alexandria’s later Christology—its “low” side. O’Keefe ar-
gues that Cyril’s Christology, viewed against its Irenaean and Athana-
sian backdrop, was profoundly driven by a particular human experience 
and a particular human hope: the human Christ gave Cyril the hope 
that the human race would one day be able to escape the violent force 
of bodily corruption, putreﬁ cation, and decay. O’Keefe urges caution 
on two fronts. Not only should we attend to the “low” side of Alexan-
drian Christology alongside its undeniably “high” concerns, but we 
must also distinguish between varieties of “low” Christologies in the 
Christian theological tradition—what registers as “low” for a Christian 
of antiquity like Cyril might not register as low for someone with a 
modern, Western sensibility. John A. McGuckin offers a focused rereading of the Chalcedonian 
creed, in search of its essence. He advances the thesis that this creed can 
easily be misread if undue accent is placed on its anathemas and on the 
literary and cultural remains of Leo’s Tome that reside within it. Mc-
Guckin argues that we need to attend with greater care to the ancient 
patterns of thinking characteristic of the many synodical processes of 
the Eastern church prior to the Chalcedonian statement. These ancient 
patterns shaped the Chalcedonian creed into an instrument of sublime 
christological praise, of celebration of the good news of Christ, and of 
pure doxology. This creed was not primarily about the resolution of a 
theological condundrum, but rather, McGuckin maintains, the restate-
ment of the soteriological mystery in doxological form that provided 
the correct lens for approaching such problems. Finally, Andrew Louth turns us to Maximus the Confessor’s re-
ﬂ ections on the transﬁ guration of Christ.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=13

10 Peter W. Martens
 re ﬂ ections on the transﬁ guration were taken up by Maximus, but were 
also transformed by their twofold location—both within the developed 
Byzantine Christology of the sixth century, as set out in the decrees of 
the ﬁ fth ecumenical council, and within a modiﬁ ed Dionysian distinc-
tion between kataphatic and apophatic theology (i.e., the theologies of 
afﬁ rmation and denial). In the tradition of Origen, the ineffability of 
God was reconciled with his manifestation in the incarnation by em-
phasizing the manifold ways in which Jesus’ disciples apprehended the 
manifestation of God; as a consequence, the notion of the inexhausti-
bility of God ruled out any one, true, iconic depiction of the incarnate 
one. For Maximus, on the other hand, this encounter with the trans-
ﬁ gured Lord was the acknowledgment of the reality of the divine 
 person of God, rather than a denial that qualiﬁ ed and limited our af-
ﬁ rmation of the revealed images of God. God’s inexhaustibility was 
 ac tually found in the person-to-person experience with the dazzling 
 radiance of the face, or divine person, of the transﬁ gured Christ. In be-
holding this face or person there was a movement beyond utterance—
the realm of the kataphatic and doctrinal—into silent wonder—the 
realm of the apophatic and iconic. Maximus’s approach to the transﬁ g-
uration, Louth argues, did not discard the icon as inadequate, but rather 
afﬁ rmed its importance by underlining the central signiﬁ cance in the-
ology of not simply afﬁ rming but also beholding and contemplating. A

The Apocalypse, Christ, and 
the Martyrs of Gaul
D. Jeffrey Bingham
I
n 43 B.C., Lucius Munatius Plancus, the governor of Further Gaul
 and a faithful servant of Julius Caesar in the Gallic wars, founded 
Roman Lugdunum, as the Senate had directed. He established the city 
on the hill of the Forum vetus, the old forum, or the fourvière hill, the 
origin of modern Lyons. Lugdunum, located at the intersection of the 
Rhone and Saône rivers, became the capital of the three Provinces of 
Gaul. On the hill the Romans built two theaters, which overlook the 
modern city. The larger, wondrously preserved Gallo-Roman theater 
could seat upwards of 10,000 spectators, while the smaller, enclosed 
Odéon seated only 2,500. Across the Saône to the north of the fourvière 
and dedicated to Augustus in 19 B.C. by the provincial priest C. Julius 
Rufus lay the “Amphitheater of the Three Gauls,” nestled on the slopes 
of the Croix-Rousse hill of Lyons. Modiﬁ ed later under Hadrian’s rule 
(A.D. 117–38), the amphitheater hosted the usual exhibitions, contests, 
games, and combats.1 Today, only meager, somewhat disappointing, 
portions of barely a third of the original amphitheater can be seen. This 
amphitheater is also the accepted location of the torture and execution

of the Christians from both Lyons and the neighboring city of Vienne, 
sixteen miles south of Lyons on the east bank of the Rhone. Our witness to this persecution is the Letter of the Churches of Lyons 
and Vienne, a selection of which is preserved in Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical 
History (5.1–3). The Letter is an account of the persecution that befell 
these churches in the summer of A.D. 177.2 Written by one or more of 
the survivors of the Gallic community—some have even argued that 
Irenaeus was its author—the Letter was sent to Asia and Phrygia.3 At-
tempts to demonstrate that the Letter was a later forgery and that the 
persecution took place in Galatia, not Gaul, have found little sym pathy.4 The tragedy began, perhaps, on 2 June and lasted until 1 August, the 
feast of the Three Gauls, commemorating the day in 12 B.C. when the 
altar to Rome and Augustus had been established. On this date, each 
year, representatives of the sixty Gallic civitates gathered to celebrate 
the cult of Rome and Augustus in Lugdunum.5 The Letter tells of the social rejection, the abuse, the accusations, 
arrests, and imprisonment of the Gallic believers.6 It recounts the  
public trial, the familiar charges of incest and cannibalism, and the 
long-drawn-out attempts to secure denials of faith. Here we learn of 
the ﬁ rmness in faith and martyrdom of Vettius Epagathus and the tor-
ture of Sanctus, Maturus, Blandina, and Attalus; of Biblis, who having 
once denied Christ, died for him; of the persecution of the Phrygian 
Christian physician Alexander, a Roman citizen; of the brutality expe-
rienced by Ponticus, a ﬁ fteen-year-old boy; and of the martyrdom of 
the bishop of Lyons, Pothinus, who died in the jail at the age of ninety. In this essay I investigate the apocalyptic motifs and role of John’s

viewed as a composite, anticipatory experience of the endtime, and as 
an apocalyptic event of the persecution of God’s people by Satan and his 
assistants. 7 Mary Hope Grifﬁ n has shown that there is a tendency for 
apocalyptically oriented communities like that of the Christians of 
Lyons to use military or battle imagery when depicting martyrdom. For these communities, martyrdom was clearly seen as combat with the 
Devil. “The Devil was incarnate in the state. ”8 William C. Weinrich 
has referred to this as the “programmatic motif for the entire letter.” P. Lanaro sees the Letter as describing an episode in Satan’s great hostile 
combat against God. The persecution makes visible in the present, 
through human drama, the conﬂ ict which has its climax in eschato-
logical catastrophe.9 In the Letter’s own words, “The adversary swooped 
down upon us with full force, giving us now (h[dh) a foretaste (prooimi-
avzw) of his unrestrained (ajdew'~) future coming. ” 10 Charles E. Hill has 
helped us in his analysis of this passage to recognize the force of the rare 
word ajdew'~.11 By assigning it a meaning of “freely, without restraint,” 
as we ﬁ nd in the entry in Lampe (on the basis of a word group associa-
tion with devw rather than with ajdehv~),12 the difference between the 
two stages of the adversary’s coming is highlighted. The ﬁ rst coming is 
restrained, incomplete—a foretaste. The second is unrestrained and 
cataclysmic. The author(s) of our text places the narrative within an

ploys the term “foretaste” (prooimiavzw) with the sense of “to introduce 
beforehand, foreshadow. ”13 This same term also occurs helpfully in Ire-
naeus. When discussing the intermediate state of the righteous, such as 
Enoch and Elijah, who were translated to paradise prior to death, Ire-
naeus writes that “there [in paradise] shall they who have been trans-
lated remain until the ﬁ nal consummation [consummation; sunteleivaı] 
as a prelude [coauspicor; prooimiavzw] to incorruptibility. ”14 In Lyons 
there is an appreciation for the concept of experiencing aspects of apoca-
lyptic eschatology in stages; prolepsis followed by consummation, fore-
taste followed by fulﬁ llment. In regard to the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne, it is not surprising to 
ﬁ nd such a connection to apocalyptic events. The association between 
martyrdom, persecution, and apocalyptic worldviews is well attested. 14 D. Jeffrey Bingham We need only recall G. W. E. Nickelsburg’s discussion of religious per-
secution in apocalyptic texts. 15 For example, Nickelsburg treats the 
themes of persecution and vindication of the righteous in 2 Maccabees 
7 and relates them to features of apocalyptic eschatology found within 
apocalypses. 16 In Maccabees the brothers die because of their obedience 
to the Torah, yet they predict that Antiochus will acclaim the one true 
God and that ultimately he will be punished. In contrast, they predict 
that they will be rescued from death through resurrection and that their 
righteousness will thereby be vindicated. 17 Though this is a text of his-
tory and not an apocalypse, Nickelsburg argues for its grounding in 
apocalyptic ideas. His evidence demonstrates that
the story preserved the hope that God would avenge [the brothers’] 
unjust deaths by means of an apocalyptic catastrophe. This story is 
then supplemented by the Isaianic exaltation tradition, which was 
also used in Antiochan times. It, too, announced an apocalyptic 
judgment on Antiochus, but it delegated the execution of his judg-
ment to the righteous whom he persecuted, thus adding to the 
original story the hope of post-mortem vindication for the righ-
teous. In 1 and 2 Maccabees, this double apocalyptic tradition is ad-
justed to certain facts of history.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=18

justed to certain facts of history. 18 
Elsewhere Nickelsburg discusses the apocalypses in Daniel, Jubilees 23, 
and the Assumption of Moses. Each is composed under persecution. In 
each, persecution is resolved only with God’s imminent judgment. But 
their apocalyptic concern does not cause a departure from the histori-
cal. Instead, “by describing history in such a way that they place them-
selves and contemporary events at the fulcrum of history and eschatol-
ogy, they offer assurance to the faithful that God will indeed act and 
that he will act quickly.”19 The apocalypses through vision, then, de-
scribe history by joining it to eschatology and by connecting the con-
temporary to the future, thus providing assurance to the persecuted. The apocalyptic themes in the Letter of the Churches of Lyons and 
Vienne are not exhausted in the concept of the proleptic experience of 
the adversary’s coming. Denis M. Farkasfalvy’s treatment of the Letter’s 
Christology brings important additional elements to the foreground. 20
The Apocalypse, Christ, and the Martyrs of Gaul 15
One of them is clariﬁ ed by the Letter’s introduction to its citation of 
 Romans 8:18 and its use of that verse. In this passage of the Letter the 
martyrs hasten to Christ in their deaths, and this haste “demonstrates 
[ejndeivknumi] that the sufferings of the present times are not compa -
rable to the future glory which is to be revealed in us.”21 The general 
apocalyptic notion of future glory drives the martyrs as they embrace 
suffering. This idea of glory is common in accounts that join persecu-
tion and apocalyptic themes, and is listed by K. Koch as one of the 
 typical motifs of apocalyptic texts. 22 As already noted, the brothers of 
2 Maccabees endured death after predicting their eschatological vindi-
cation and delivery. What is remarkable about the Letter’s use of Ro-
mans 8:18, however, is its emphasis that “the suffering of the martyrs 
manifests the truth of the saying that the future glory is incomparable to 
our present suffering. This manifestation, of course, displays an antici-
pated glory amidst actual suffering, glory perceivable only to the eye of 
faith. ”23 Here Farkasfalvy orients us, through another aspect of the 
 Letter, to an idea already addressed above.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=19

strained manner, and the future glory is being manifested in events 
of the ﬂ esh, though in a manner visible only to the spiritual eye. The 
 Letter certainly brings the adversary into the present. And the Letter 
“brings both the expected glory and the truth of Scripture into evi-
dence, almost within reach, although without suppressing its eschato-
logical dimension.”24 
Two other apocalyptic themes in the Letter deserve mention. First 
is the theme of the victor’s crown, “the crown of incorruptibility,” a re-
ward that appears three times in the Letter. 25 Recognizing that this im-
agery has both Jewish and Hellenistic roots, Farkasfalvy draws atten-
tion to its New Testament background (1 Cor 9:25; 1 Pet 5:4; 2 Tim 
4:6–8; Rev 2:10; James 1:12). The language of 1 Peter 5:4 makes the es-
chatological identity of the crown explicit—its reception is linked to the 
Chief Shepherd’s appearance, an important apocalyptic motif of the 
mediator who appears to accomplish ﬁ nal redemption. 26 The Letter 
 alludes to this verse when it speciﬁ cally mentions that the maiden Blan-
dina, the victorious athlete in her martyrdom, had defeated Satan

who had come: she “had overcome the adversary in many contests, and 
through her conﬂ icts had won the crown of incorruptibility.”27 It is par-
ticularly stunning to note the language of 1 Peter 5:4 and that of the 
Letter as it relates to the story of Blandina. In 1 Peter we ﬁ nd: “you will 
obtain the unfading crown of glory” when Christ appears, emphasizing 
the future reality. Not so for Blandina. She “was crowned” with the 
crown, emphasizing the already received award. Once more, we see 
that apocalyptic events are viewed proleptically in Lyons at the time of 
the persecution. Second is the theme of renewed life. This repeatedly occurs in the 
epistle, and we ﬁ nd it associated with the motifs of restoration, rebirth, 
and resurrection.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=20

that apocalyptic events are viewed proleptically in Lyons at the time of 
the persecution. Second is the theme of renewed life. This repeatedly occurs in the 
epistle, and we ﬁ nd it associated with the motifs of restoration, rebirth, 
and resurrection. To begin with, the martyrs hope for the eschatologi-
cal resurrection or bodily restoration. At one point in the narrative the 
Romans refuse to allow the bodies of the dead martyrs to be buried. In-
stead, they eventually cremate them and scatter the ashes in the Rhone. The Letter reports that the Romans “did this as though they could over-
come God and deprive the martyrs of their restoration.”28 Here the 
 Letter attests to the hope of resurrection that strengthened the martyrs’ 
advance toward the end. But, the concept of life is not exhausted in 
the notion of eschatological resurrection. Quite pointedly, the Letter ex-
pressed the conviction that the martyrs received life from God at their 
death,29 and that in the renewed faith of those who had previously 
borne no witness, those who had been dead in their denial were re-
stored to life in their confession and martyrdom.30 In other imagery 
within the Letter, the martyrs have not been victimized in their deaths 
but rather transported to a “bridal banquet” and “eternal fellowship 
with the living God.”31 For the martyrs of Gaul, the motif of renewed 
life, common to apocalyptic eschatology, is not purely future. Life is 
found in bearing witness, in martyrdom. In the Amphitheater of the 
Three Gauls, apocalyptic eschatology has disrupted the violent games 
of the Romans. While it may, then, have been an exaggeration for Ernst Käsemann 
to have stated that “apocalyptic was the mother of all Christian theol-
ogy,” it seems appropriate to say that for the Christians of Lyons and 
Vienne, apocalyptic was the mother of martyrdom, of witness. 32 It 
brought forth the living. In the Letter this is made very clear in striking

terms, immediately after the stories of the deaths of Maturus and Sanc-
tus and the seemingly never-ending suffering of Blandina. These sto-
ries make repeated references to the eschatological crown, indicating

The Apocalypse of John in the LETTER
Motifs of apocalyptic eschatology are clearly present in the Letter, and 
their important function repeatedly emerges. But apocalyptic eschatol-
ogy is present in the Letter in a way other than by motif. John’s Apoca-
lypse also plays a role in its composition. While the Letter’s use of 
Scripture has received some attention,34 to my knowledge no one has 
treated in a concentrated fashion the role of the book of Revelation 
within it. The ﬁ rst citation from John’s Apocalypse occurs in an account con-
cerning Vettius Epagathus (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.9–10). He is a young man 
who, we are told, loved God and neighbor and walked blamelessly, and 
he is even compared to Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist (Luke 
1:6). Vettius Epagathus, though not yet arrested himself, spoke in de-
fense of Christians, was interrogated by the prefect, confessed his own 
Christianity, and, full of the same Holy Spirit who had ﬁ lled Zechariah 
(Luke 1:67), was martyred. By fullness of love he manifested the ﬁ lling 
of the Spirit and with pleasure laid down even his own life in defense of 
his fellow Christians. This, of course, calls forth the words of John in 
1 John 3:16: “By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us; and 
we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.” Immediately follow-
ing the implicitly drawn parallel between Vettius Epagathus and Jesus 
Christ comes the citation from Revelation 14:4 making the parallel 
 explicit: “He was and is a true disciple of Christ, ‘following the Lamb 
wherever he goes.’” 18 D. Jeffrey Bingham Those of whom John speaks in Revelation 14 are the 144,000 stand-
ing with the Lamb on Mount Zion. They are chaste, blameless, tell the 
truth, and have not received the number of the Beast on their foreheads 
(Rev 13:16–17).",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=22

truth, and have not received the number of the Beast on their foreheads 
(Rev 13:16–17). Instead, they have the name of the Lamb and the Fa-
ther (14:1–5). Vettius Epagathus is set before the reader as the one who 
imitates the Lamb in his death on behalf of others and as a member of 
the eschatological community of the blameless, who are aligned not 
with the Beast but with the Lamb. That community is not merely es-
chatological, however. Its membership already includes the faithful of 
Lyons and Vienne. Mount Zion upon which the Lamb and the 144,000 
stand has become, in this proleptic moment, the Croix-Rousse hill. That the community of the Gallic martyrs is associated with the 
apocalyptic 144,000 is also made clear at the beginning of the Letter, 
which describes how the believers were barred from the baths, public 
square, and all other social places and markets (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.5). Reve-
lation 13, in parallel, describes how the people of the apocalyptic times 
cannot trade in the marketplaces unless they have the Beast’s mark 
(13:16–17). Furthermore, “the whole earth” follows the Beast in Reve-
lation 13:3, while in the Letter (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.5) the Adversary who 
swoops down upon Lyons and Vienne prepares his own people to be 
poised against God’s people. The Beast’s abusive community is de-
scribed as “the whole people,” and the Christians are brought before 
“the entire population. ”35
Continuing to associate the Gallic martyrs with the apocalyptic 
community of blessing, the Letter contrasts the faithful with the un-
faithful believers and states that the former manifested countenances of 
joy, majesty, and beauty, to the degree that they bore their shackles as if 
they were lovely ornaments ﬁ t “for a bride adorned” with golden em-
broidery. 36 This language is dependent on the epithalamium of Psalm 
45:12–15 and the apocalyptic use to which John puts that imagery in 
Revelation 19:7 and 21:2, 9. The one who is “as a bride adorned” for her 
husband, the Lamb in John’s Apocalypse, has clothed herself with the 
ﬁ ne, bright, pure linen of righteousness. She is the New Jerusalem who 
descends from heaven upon the new earth with the radiance and clarity 
of precious jewels and crystal.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=23

lyptic presence of God with humanity that vanquishes sorrow, death,

and suffering. Already in A.D. 177 this city had descended upon the 
earth of the Amphitheater of the Three Gauls and included within its 
population the martyrs whose blood stained its dust. Of Blandina, it is 
said, in a manner which maintains the imagery, that she rejoiced and 
gloriﬁ ed in her death as if she had been invited to a “bridal supper.” An 
angel in Revelation 19:9 proclaims to John that those invited to “the 
marriage supper” of the Lamb are blessed. Blandina in her death has 
already been seated at the Lamb’s apocalyptic nuptial feast. The mar-
tyrs of Lyons are those who know and already wear the “wedding 
 garment” and experience blessings associated with it.37 Though the 
martyrs experience inexpressible torment, they also, remarkably, expe-
rience relief from their suffering. Their association with the marriage 
and its feast, with its victory over suffering, brings to them anesthetic 
strengthening, refreshment, and even a cure (cf. Hist. Eccl. 5.1.19, 22, 
23, 24, 28). Toward the end of the Letter (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.57–63) another refer-
ence to the end of John’s Apocalypse appears. The accusers of the Chris-
tians are described as exercising wanton violence, hatred, and cruelty 
against the Christians in the manner in which they treat the bodies of 
the martyrs after their deaths. The bodies of those who had been stran-
gled in the prison were thrown to the dogs (Ps 79:2), while the bodies of 
those who had been burnt and torn apart were left unburied and 
guarded for six days. Eventually they were cremated and the remains 
cast into the Rhone. Drawing on the language of Psalm 79:3–4, some of 
the Romans are described as raging and gnashing their teeth at the bod-
ies in a continuation of their vengeance. Within this context the Letter 
loosely cites Revelation 22:11: “Let the wicked be wicked still and the 
righteous righteous still. ”38 The Gallic Christians viewed this passage as 
a prophecy that was fulﬁ lled in the desecration of the bodies of their 
martyrs.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=24

a prophecy that was fulﬁ lled in the desecration of the bodies of their 
martyrs. But there is more to the Romans’ deﬁ lement of the bodies of the 
martyrs than this. In Revelation 11:1–13 the prophecy of the two wit-
nesses is recorded. For 1260 days they will be given power to prophesy 
with great testifying powers. When they ﬁ nish their testimony the 
apocalyptic beast who arises from the pit will kill them, “and their dead
20 D. Jeffrey Bingham
bodies will lie in the street” (11:8). For three and a half days an interna-
tional procession of people will view their bodies and refuse to bury 
them, rejoicing and celebrating in apparent vengeance the death of the 
prophets who had tormented them. After three and a half days the two 
prophets are raised by God from the dead and are translated to 
heaven. The author(s) of the Letter wants the reader to understand that the 
Gallic “martyrs” are, in a proleptic manner, the apocalyptic witnesses 
and martyrs prophesied in Revelation 11. They share the bodily dese-
cration and endure together the rage, celebration, and mocking of the 
people. They also share the apocalyptic beast as the leader of the wick-
edness. The Letter states, prior to its account of the desecration and ci-
tation of Revelation 22:11, that the people were led forward by “the 
wild beast,” a synonym for the adversary who appears at the beginning 
of the Letter (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.5); this adversary shows up again as “the 
Devil” and “the evil one” (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.6; 5.1.25, 35), and makes a ﬁ nal 
appearance at the end as the beast (Hist. Eccl. 5.2.6). It is with reference 
to the apocalyptic beast who governs the whole persecution that the 
multiple references to the beasts that maul the martyrs are to be under-
stood. 39 The beasts are the tools of the beast. Finally, we should make mention of the apparent discrepancy be-
tween the prophecy given to John and the Gallic persecution. While it 
could be argued that the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne were not raised 
bodily, and as such, this marks a decisive difference between the Letter 
and Revelation 11, it could also be argued that such a discrepancy is 
 beside the point.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=25

tween the prophecy given to John and the Gallic persecution. While it 
could be argued that the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne were not raised 
bodily, and as such, this marks a decisive difference between the Letter 
and Revelation 11, it could also be argued that such a discrepancy is 
 beside the point. The Gallic martyrs are, after all, given life, because 
faithful witness is life, while faithless denial is death. They have been 
crowned and seated at the feast. With such a reading, moreover, escha-
tological tension is heightened. The Gallic martyrs still await bodily 
resurrection in parallel with the two mysterious witnesses in Reve-
lation 11. As was the case with those witnesses, who remained dead for 
three and half days before God breathed life into them (cf. 11:7–11), so 
too with the Gallic martyrs, who await consummative resurrection and 
restoration. The Letter to the Churches of Lyons and Vienne clearly demonstrates, 
then, the centrality not only of apocalyptic motifs but also of the Johan- The Apocalypse, Christ, and the Martyrs of Gaul 21
nine Apocalypse in the lives and deaths of the martyrs of Gaul. The 
perspectives and motifs in John’s text undoubtedly strengthened those 
who underwent the tortures, as well as helping the survivors interpret 
what had taken place. Apocalyptic motifs and literature affect commu-
nities both prospectively as they undergo martyrdoms and retrospec-
tively as they attempt to come to terms with them. Christology: The Sacrificial Lamb But what of the Christology of the Letter that arises out of its apoca-
lyptic motifs and its particular dependence on the Apocalypse of John? Of course, it includes the notion of Jesus Christ as Lord in fellowship 
with God the Father and his Spirit (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.3, 34), who, to return 
to Farkasfalvy, “is actively present in the life of the Church and the in-
dividual Christian.”40 He is the Lord who is “both cruciﬁ ed and glori-
ous, both present in history and still to come, ‘a noble and victorious 
athlete’ who continues to be involved in bloody ﬁ ghting, repeated trials, 
and unceasing tribulations.”41 His “glorious life belongs to a realm other 
than this earth,” but in martyrdom there is already participation in that 
glory. 42 Undoubtedly, Farkasfalvy’s great contribution has been to ori-
ent us to “the image of Christ, present on every page of the document” 
from Lyons, which is the image not “of the suffering but of the glorious 
Christ.”43 More can be said, however.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=26

church, W. H. C. Frend comments that behind the practice of martyr-
dom was a theology that proclaimed that the martyrs “were seeking by 
their death to attain to the closest possible imitation of Christ’s passion 
and death. This was the heart of their attitude, Christ himself suffered 
in the martyr.”44 This comment is the springboard for my present dis-
cussion of the Christology of the Letter of the Churches of Lyons and 
 Vienne, and in particular, its use of Revelation 14:4, where it speaks of 
those who follow Christ, the “Lamb.” There are two such references 
in the Letter. Frend has already identiﬁ ed the ﬁ rst, where Vettius Epa-
gathus is depicted as one who conducts himself as a disciple, a follower 
of Christ, the Lamb, by imitating him in death.45 The second, not
22 D. Jeffrey Bingham
 mentioned by Frend, is the imagistic depiction of Blandina as the bride 
of the Lamb (Rev 19:7; 21:2, 9) at the apocalyptic wedding feast of 
the Lamb.46 The image of Blandina the bride evokes the image of the 
groom, the Lamb, just as the image of Vettius Epagathus, the follower, 
evokes the image of the Lord, the Lamb, who gives himself to death. The question is the signiﬁ cance of these references to the Lamb and his 
followers in the Letter. Do they suggest a sacriﬁ cial aspect to Christ’s 
death? I propose that the communities of Lyons and Vienne must have 
read the text in a way that understood the Lamb of the Apocalypse as a 
sacriﬁ cial victim. By depicting a martyr such as Vettius Epagathus as 
following the “Lamb,” all martyrs are being depicted as sacriﬁ cial vic-
tims approaching their martyrdom.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=27

standing of the followers of the Lamb as sacriﬁ cial victims also sheds 
light on how the “Lamb” itself was understood: its slaughter is a sacri-
ﬁ ce. There is additional evidence for this reading of the Lamb imagery 
in the Letter. In particular, by dying for God in imitation of Christ, the 
martyrs of Lyons and Vienne believed their deaths were sacriﬁ cial.47 
For instance, the Letter (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.40–41) speaks of Maturus and 
Sanctus as those who, in the end, were “sacriﬁ ced” (quvw), and of Blan-
dina hanging from a “tree” (xuvlon) seemingly in the form of a “cross” 
(staurov~). In this scene, those witnessing her death recognized in her 
a sacriﬁ ce, like Christ, “who was cruciﬁ ed for them.” This description 
of Blandina on the tree (which usually, unfortunately, is translated as 
“post”) of course looks back to Deuteronomy 21:23 and reﬂ ects a Chris-
tian interpretation evident in Acts 5:30 and Galatians 3:13.48 Both Peter 
and Paul apply the prophecy of the curse that comes to all who hang 
“on a tree” (Deut 21:23) to Christ and his cruciﬁ xion. Christ became “a 
curse for us,” thereby accomplishing redemption. Finally, we should 
also note the passage (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.52) that describes Attalus’s ﬂ esh as 
roasting. The odor that arises is described as that of a burning sacriﬁ ce 
(knivsa).49 Both Attalus and Alexander “were sacriﬁ ced” (quvw) at the 
end.50 Blandina, the Letter says, was also “offered in sacriﬁ ce” (quvw).51
Exactly how martyrs perceived their sacriﬁ cial offering is not en-
tirely clear. Scholarship over the last thirty years has suggested diverse

emphases and taxonomies. 52 Frances M. Young, in her brief comments

taxonomy ﬁ ts well with the evidence gathered in this essay, since the 
community that produced the Letter interpreted its persecution in 
terms of the drama of eschatological conﬂ ict between Satan and God. Overcoming the Devil was assured in dying for God (cf. Hist. Eccl. 
5.1.23, 27). This had been the pattern established by Christ, and the 
 pattern was now continued by his followers, with one notable excep-
tion: in the deaths of Christ’s followers we are no longer on Golgotha 
but on the Croix-Rousse within the eschatological battle described in 
John’s Apocalypse. This eschatological battle was largely about ideology: about faith 
against sight, virtue against evil, reality against illusion. The battle was, 
to be more precise, apologetic and revelatory. Several times in the  
Letter, martyrdom is presented as an argument by Christians against 
the worldly ideology of the persecutors and the Adversary. Martyrdom 
proves (ejpideivknumi) that temporal suffering does not compare to es-
chatological glory (cf. Rom 8:18; Hist. Eccl. 5.1.6). Vettius Epagathus 
gives his life in defense (ajpologevw) of his fellow Christians, who are 
falsely charged with atheism and impiety (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.9, 10). Through 
Blandina’s witness Christ proves (ejpideivknumi) that those things viewed 
contemptuously by the Adversary’s agents are actually glorious (Hist. 
Eccl. 5.1.17). The suffering of Sanctus, which is the suffering of Christ 
in him, shows (uJpodeivknumi) that nothing frightening or painful occurs 
where the Father’s love and Christ’s glory are present (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.23). Again, Blandina’s sacriﬁ ce is equated to Christ convincing (peivqw) be-
lievers that martyrs “will have eternal fellowship with the living God” 
(Hist. Eccl. 5.1.41). In this way, then, in their suffering and their deaths 
they are already participating in something otherworldly, something 
eschatological, something beyond the bitter conﬁ nes of the temporal 
moment under the scorching rays of the Gallic summer sun and the vile 
contempt of the Romans. The victorious age to come, although masked 
and costumed in defeat, makes a measured, uninvited appearance at 
the Romans’ bloody feast. 24 D. Jeffrey Bingham

Conclusion The tortures that took place in second-century Lyons were certainly, 
from the perspective of the Christian communities involved, events as-
sociated with athletic competition (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.42) and gladiatorial 
combat (Hist. Eccl. 5.1.40), both of which were seen as anticipatory es-
chatological struggles against the Evil One. But in the Amphitheater of 
the Three Gauls we are not only seated within a stadium or around a 
ﬁ eld. We are within a temple. The followers of the Lamb placed the passion and death of Christ 
at the center of their Christology and discipleship. By employing their 
own understanding of sacriﬁ cial suffering as imitation of Christ, we 
can see that for them, Christ was fundamentally the slaughtered, sac-
riﬁ cial lamb whose death was expiatory but also revelatory and apolo-
getic. Christ’s sacriﬁ cial offering of himself manifested surprising, 
shocking, and apparently irrational, unsubstantiated claims to a world 
deceived by the powers of darkness. Martyrdom and sacriﬁ ce brought 
light within that darkness. For the martyrs of Gaul, the Apocalypse and leading apocalyptic 
motifs portray an existence in which the eschatological conﬂ ict has been 
made, in some measure, present, and which requires for victory a re-
turn to the model of warfare established in Jerusalem three generations 
before. This Lamb was slain in sacriﬁ ce, and it was this Lamb who ap-
peared to John the Seer (Rev 5:6) and whom the martyrs followed (Rev 
14:4). Such a portrayal of the death of the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne 
clearly exhibits an early Christian exegesis of the Apocalypse and an 
early Christology centered upon sacriﬁ ce. Notes

Athanasius’s Christology Today 
The Life, Death, and Resurrection of Christ 
in On the Incarnation
Khaled Anatolios
I
n his essay “Christology Today?”1 Karl Rahner begins with an ac-
 knowledgment that the articulation of a Christology adequate to 
our time must be in fundamental continuity with that of “classical 
Christology.” The rationale for this assertion is that classical Chris-
tology is formative of the consciousness of the church, which is where 
God’s deﬁ nitive and irrevocable Word in Christ is continually actual-
ized. It is also because “classical Christology” gives normative expres-
sion to what is most essential in the kerygma of the gospel, that in Christ 
humanity is gifted with an unsurpassable communion with God 
through God’s own human self-expression in Jesus Christ. At the same 
time, Rahner believes that such faithfulness to “classical Christology” 
must be open to an acknowledgment of its limitations vis-à-vis our 
modern sensibilities. In outlining these limitations, Rahner character-
izes “classical Christology” as preoccupied with “ontological” catego-
ries (such as “person” and “nature”) that are located within a descending 
“incarnational” framework. Such an ontological Christology needs to
30 Khaled Anatolios
be supplemented by a “functional” Christology that draws attention to 
the salviﬁ c work of Christ pro nobis, in his life, death and resurrection.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=35
36,"It is also because “classical Christology” gives normative expres-

30 Khaled Anatolios
be supplemented by a “functional” Christology that draws attention to 
the salviﬁ c work of Christ pro nobis, in his life, death and resurrection. This supplementation, articulated in “simpler statements which we 
ﬁ nd more accessible today and yet which underlie those of classical 
Christology,”2 is the task of Christology today. As is typical with Rahner, his essay strikes a carefully poised bal-
ance between a discerning ﬁ delity to what is most essential in the tradi-
tion and a creative openness to the requirements of proclaiming the 
gospel in our own time. Yet, it is also typical in manifesting certain 
problematic features in modern “systematic” readings of the “classical 
christological” tradition. The heart of the problem is uncovered as soon 
as we pose the question: what exactly is meant here by “classical Chris-
tology”? For the most part, it seems that by this phrase Rahner is allud-
ing to the formulae of church councils, such as Nicaea, Ephesus, and 
Chalcedon.3 There are at least two signiﬁ cant drawbacks to this ap-
proach. The ﬁ rst is that the terse formulae of such councils cannot be 
made to bear the weight of representing in themselves wholly elabo-
rated theological systems; they are merely attempts to provide the most 
basic guidelines in adjudicating debates that predate and postdate them, 
and these guidelines cannot be understood apart from the contextual-
ization of such debates. Perusing conciliar formulae cannot of itself 
give us complete access to “classical Christology.” The second draw-
back is that a narrow focus on conciliar formulae, especially Chalcedon, 
easily leads us to an anachronistic conception of the category of “Chris-
tology” itself. “Christology,” read backwards from a post-Chalcedonian 
perspective, tends to refer to an analysis of the “composition” of the 
identity of Jesus Christ: one person in two natures. Thus by deﬁ ning 
“classical Christology” with primary reference to conciliar formulae, 
Rahner is understandably led to the conclusion that it is a “descending” Christology of the incarnation, which favors ontological vocabulary 
rather than functional, soteriological, and existential categories.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=36

Rahner’s project of a creative ﬁ delity to the church’s tradition of chris-
tological proclamation with a view to its modern appropriation is better 
advanced if we ask these soteriological and existential questions pre-
cisely of “classical Christology,” considered more widely than Rahner 
typically does. Athanasius’s Christology Today 31 In this essay, I make this endeavor with regard to Athanasius, a ﬁ g-
ure who is typically regarded even by patristic scholars as representa-
tive of a Christology that favors the category of “incarnation” over 
“death and resurrection.” For the sake of brevity and a close adherence 
to the text, I conﬁ ne myself here to the second part of Athanasius’s clas-
sical double treatise, Against the Greeks–On the Incarnation. I begin by 
asking in what sense we can speak of Athanasius’s “Christology,” as it 
appears in this treatise. I then try to show how the “functional” catego-
ries of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ ﬁ gure within Athana-
sius’s christological vision.4 Finally, I try to follow Rahner’s recommen-
dation of translating the basic insights of Athanasius’s “Christology” 
into simple intelligible statements that have a concrete bearing on the 
experience of the Christian faith. The goal of such an analysis is not to 
claim that, after all, the “classical Christology” elaborated by Athana-
sius is completely sufﬁ cient for all ages and requires no modern supple-
mentation. Rather, in agreement with Rahner’s own principle that 
Christology requires an integration of ontological and functional cate-
gories, the goal is to discern how Athanasius attempts this integration 
himself. Hopefully, such discernment will provide resources for at-
tempting this task in our own context. Can We Speak of a “Christology” in Athanasius? It might seem self-evident that we can speak of a “Christology” in the 
work of Athanasius, or in any of the classical theologians of the early 
church. After all, the term can be simply deﬁ ned as “discourse about 
Christ,” which is not lacking in any of these theologians. But it should 
give us some pause that the term is not used by Athanasius, nor is it 
used generally in the early church.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=37

to construe the signiﬁ cation of the term in a post-Chalcedonian frame-
work in which it refers principally to an ontological analysis of the 
identity of Jesus Christ as divine and human. In that sense, however, it 
is important to recognize that we do not ﬁ nd a full-ﬂ edged “Chris-
tology” in the work of Athanasius. It is true that Athanasius does 
make statements in this treatise that tend in that direction. He makes
32 Khaled Anatolios
statements about the integral humanity and divinity of Christ, about 
how the humanity is “appropriated” by the divinity, and about how 
human and divine attributes are predicated of one and the same sub-
ject.5 But if we look at his classical work, Against the Greeks– On the In-
carnation, we do not ﬁ nd that the overarching framework is that of a 
“Christology” in the narrow sense of an ontological analysis of the iden-
tity of Christ.6 Rather, the overarching framework is a narrative ac-
count of human reality in which the Christ event is the salviﬁ c climax 
and hermeneutical key. Insofar as it is an apologetic work, it is intended 
to make an intelligible defense of the Christian faith as centered on the 
worship of a cruciﬁ ed God.7 Non-Christians mock this cornerstone of 
the Christian faith as irrational, alogon. Athanasius therefore intends to 
render an account of the rationale of this faith. He does this not from 
the perspective of a neutral standpoint of presuppositionless reason but 
by showing how the Christian faith, centered on the cruciﬁ ed Logos, 
represents a coherent and intelligible account of reality. If we speak, 
then, of Athanasius’s “Christology” in this work, we must give it that 
signiﬁ cation which arises from the text itself, where what is primarily 
at stake is not an explanation or analysis of the internal composition of 
the person of Christ, but rather an account of how the humanization 
of the Word and the life, death, and resurrection of Christ make sense of 
human reality. It is a project that is very much in line with Rahner’s call 
for an existential and functional Christology, and thus invites an appro-
priation in the idiom of our own times. The Salvific Value of the Life of Christ

in ON THE INCARNATION In his account of the limitations of “classical Christology,” Rahner com-
plains that it “does not sufﬁ ciently and directly make clear the connec-
tion between the incarnate Logos and his function as the mediator of 
salvation.”8 Rahner immediately qualiﬁ es this statement by conceding 
that such a connection was in fact made, albeit inadequately. This in-
adequacy is due to the supplanting of the concrete reality of the life and 
death of Jesus in favor of abstractly Platonic and speculative categories
Athanasius’s Christology Today 33
which posit a divine-human subject assuming the entirety of human 
“nature”: But above all a vertical incarnational and “descent” Christology of 
this kind, considered in isolation, involves a limitation and a dan-
ger. For it ﬁ rst talks only about the adoption of a human nature 
which remains abstract. It does not simply begin from the very out-
set with the actual, speciﬁ c reality of Jesus’ life and death. Yet after 
all it is this which we experience ﬁ rst of all, and it is this that we 
grasp in faith and hope as what is saving and liberating for our-
selves.9 On this point, Rahner’s general critique of classical Christology can be 
reinforced by certain assessments of patristic scholars about Athana-
sius’s Christology. His Christology and soteriology are sometimes held 
to involve a “physical” transaction between the Logos and human na-
ture as a whole, considered as a Platonic “form.”10 In the context of this 
critique, the project of looking for resources within patristic Chris-
tology for a modern updating leads us to ask the question whether in 
fact the speciﬁ city of Jesus’ life and death was a signiﬁ cant feature of

40,"His Christology and soteriology are sometimes held 
to involve a “physical” transaction between the Logos and human na-
ture as a whole, considered as a Platonic “form.”10 In the context of this 
critique, the project of looking for resources within patristic Chris-
tology for a modern updating leads us to ask the question whether in 
fact the speciﬁ city of Jesus’ life and death was a signiﬁ cant feature of 
Athanasius’s Christology. To begin with, what did the human life of Jesus mean for Athana-
sius’s Christology and soteriology in On the Incarnation? We can start 
with what it did not mean. Nowhere do we ﬁ nd any evidence in this 
text for a notion of a Platonic “form” of humanity salviﬁ cally assumed 
by the Logos, despite the following assessment by J. N. D. Kelly: “Atha-
nasius’s language often suggests that he conceived of human nature, 
after the manner of Platonic realism, as a concrete idea or universal in 
which all individual men participate. From this point of view, when the 
Word assumed it and suffused it with his divinity, the divinizing force 
would be communicated to all mankind, and the incarnation would in 
effect be the redemption. ”11 Such a reading would justify the double 
critique that Athanasius overlooks the speciﬁ city of Jesus’ life as well as 
the soteriological value of his death. It is not a reading, however, that is 
supported by the text. Athanasius typically speaks of the incarnation in 
terms of the Word’s assumption not of a human “nature” but  speciﬁ cally
34 Khaled Anatolios
“a body,” and, to be more precise, “one body, like our own.”12 A telling 
analogy that he employs in articulating the salviﬁ c effect of the incarna-
tion is that of a criminal-infested city which experiences a new level of 
safety when the king takes up residence in its midst: “When a great 
king enters a large city and takes up residence in one of the houses in it, 
such a city becomes worthy of great honor and is no longer assaulted by 
any enemy or bandit descending upon it, but is rather deemed worthy 
of every attention because of the king residing in one of its houses. So it 
is with the king of all.”13 The analogy here does not seem to be based on 
a conception of the Word uniting himself with the totality of human 
nature but rather with a singular instance of human reality (“one body”) 
which makes him accessible to relation with other human beings. Such 
a conception is further reinforced by Athanasius’s typical manner of re-
ferring to the salviﬁ c value of our “kinship” or “similitude” to Christ’s 
body.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=40

language is much more readily explicable with reference to its eucha-
ristic connotations. 15 In his Life of Antony, as well as in his anti-Arian 
polemic, we have abundant indications that Athanasius considered 
such kinship to be not an automatic process, Platonic or otherwise, 
but a discipleship that involved appropriation of the “ecclesiastical” 
kerygma and a life of imitation of Christ. 16 It could be argued, of course, that we still have here a “descending” 
Christology, in which the value of Christ’s embodied life is conceived 
largely in terms of its union with the Word. Indeed, it must be con-
ceded that Athanasius always conceives of Jesus Christ as the enﬂ eshed 
Word, and to that extent his is always a descending Christology. But it 
is not thereby an abstract conception that jettisons functional categories 
in favor of ontological ones that do not have a bearing on Christians’ 
concrete experiences. If we are correct in presuming the eucharistic 
connotations of Athanasius’s use of the motif of Christ’s body, we can 
understand his emphasis on the human bodiliness of Christ precisely as 
an afﬁ rmation that a signiﬁ cant salviﬁ c “function” of the incarnation is

cusses how the embodied life of Christ provides accessible knowledge 
of the transcendent God. Athanasius elaborates this theme by inserting 
the Johannine motifs of Jesus’ “works” (erga) and “signs” (se¯meia) within 
a reading of salvation history as the interplay between God’s efforts to 
share knowledge of himself with humanity and humanity’s frustrations 
of these efforts. 17 Prior to the incarnation, God had endeavored to im-
part knowledge of himself to humanity through humanity’s being cre-
ated according to the image of the Logos and through the revelation 
mediated by the law and the prophets. 18 But humanity still largely failed 
in the project of knowing God; they “did not look toward the truth” 
but became “irrational” and imprisoned in the merely immanent and 
sensible. 19 In departing from communion with God, humanity was de-
prived of the knowledge of God, thus perpetuating a vicious circle in 
which lack of the knowledge of God further detracts from communion 
with God. Such a chasm between God and humanity entailed a decon-
struction of humanity’s being “in the image” and an affront to divine 
glory, since the lack of humanity’s knowledge of God entailed a failure 
to properly “honor” God.20 Both God’s glory and humanity’s salvation 
required a divine intervention of an altogether different order than that 
of creation and divine instruction through the law and the prophets. This intervention is enacted in the incarnation of the Word. The sal-
viﬁ c value of the concrete human life of Jesus Christ is that it accommo-
dates to human sensibilities and reveals the knowledge of the Father:",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=42

human being, taking to himself a body like other human beings, so 
that from the things below—that is, from the works of the body—
those who did not wish to know him through his providence and 
rule over the universe, might come to know through the works of 
his own body the Word of God who was in the body, and through 
him, the Father.21
The Incarnation of the Word then represents God’s own self- 
communication “from below,” his pedagogical condescension in ac-
commodating knowledge of himself to humanity’s preoccupation with 
the sensible. In Christ, therefore, the contemplation of God is no longer

a matter of simply abstracting from the sensible, as it generally is in 
Greek thought. The incarnation of the Word means that the contem-
plation of God is now anchored in the human bodily reality of Jesus of 
Nazareth. In this way, the concrete life of Jesus Christ has soteriologi-
cal signiﬁ cance for Athanasius. That is why, explains Athanasius, the 
Word did not simply become incarnate and then die on our behalf, but 
spent a human lifetime accomplishing the “works” and “signs” that 
rendered visible the knowledge of God.22 So we ﬁ nd in On the Incarnation that a key functional category for 
articulating the salviﬁ c value of Jesus’ humanly embodied life is that 
Jesus’ bodiliness provides a humanly accessible locus for God’s self-
communication. It is implied that we have this tangible access to the 
humanity of Jesus through participation in the eucharist, whereby we

For Rahner, it is precisely the death and resurrection of Jesus that re-
veals him to be God’s irrevocable Word who has a unique relationship 
to God. Jesus is revealed to be God’s all-encompassing Word to hu-
manity insofar as he is the one in whom the extreme limit of human an-
nihilation is taken over and replaced by the extreme limit of divine 
afﬁ rmation: “But when the whole of our existence and history is all at 
once withdrawn from us and struck out by what we call death—when 
such an all-annihilating ‘nay’ is heard and this, just this and nothing 
else, becomes the divine ‘yea’—then such a divine Word must neces-
sarily be irrevocable and deﬁ nitive.”23

obediently accepting the death for which he was destined, can offer 
God in his holiness expiation and satisfaction for the guilt of man-

can show that it is sufﬁ ciently anchored in the actual text of Athanasius 
to be allowed as a legitimate hermeneutical “fusion of horizons.” The 
explication of Athanasius’s understanding of the salviﬁ c value of Jesus’ 
death must begin with his anthropology, which is based on a strong em-
phasis on the notion of creation from nothing. Human existence is con-
ceived as a movement from nothing into being, through participation 
in the Word. This movement is initiated by God and sustained through 
the adherence of the human will to the continuing divine offer of grace. In Athanasius’s account, God’s original intention for human existence 
included the endowment of immortality. But the effect of sin was to re-
verse the direction of the movement of human existence, from partici-
pation in divine life to death and nothingness. In this sense, Athanasius 
understands the category of death not merely as signifying the end of 
vital bodily functions, but as inclusive generally of the breakdown of 
divine-human communion by which the integrity of human life is

who was made rational and according to the image [of God] was being 
wiped out; the work created by God was being destroyed.”28
An acknowledgment of Athanasius’s double starting point of cre-
ation from nothing and sin as reversion to nothingness enables us to 
 situate properly his understanding of Christ’s salviﬁ c death. This un-
derstanding presumes a certain integration, embedded in his theologi-
cal anthropology, of the categories of nature and law as applied to 
human death. With respect to the category of nature and from the per-
spective of his ontology of creation, Athanasius understands human 
death and the decline into nothingness as the inescapably necessary and 
natural consequence of humanity’s volitional withdrawal from parti-
cipation in divine grace. Since human existence is a movement from 
nothing into participation in the Word, humanity’s rejection of such 
participation ineluctably leads it back to nothingness. At the same time, 
Athanasius speaks of the death-nothingness that is consequent upon sin 
as instituted by divine law and as incurring a debt against God which 
must be repaid. But in interpreting his use of these primordially biblical 
rather than Germanic categories, it is crucial to note how the language 
of law and debt is derivative of the language of grace and mercy. We 
ﬁ nd this signiﬁ cant ordering of these notions exempliﬁ ed in De incar-
natione 3–5. Here Athanasius speaks of creation from nothing with pri-
mary reference to the categories of divine goodness, mercy, and grace: 
God is good—or rather, he is the source of goodness. But the good 
is not begrudging of anything. Because he does not begrudge being 
to anything, he made all things from non-being through his own 
Word, our Lord Jesus Christ. Among all the things upon the earth, 
he was especially merciful toward the human race. Seeing that by 
the logic of its own origin it would not be capable of always re-
maining, he granted it a further gift.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=47

Athanasius’s Christology Today 39
We glean from this passage that the fundamental structure of the 
 divine-human relation is that of gift-giving on the part of God. That 
creation came to be from nothing bespeaks the radicality of this gift; 
that humanity is made according to the Image who is the Word be-
speaks the extremity of the gift, the “added grace.” Athanasius speaks 
of the law and its accompanying threat within this framework of gift 
and grace. Indeed, this law is conceived precisely as an instrument for 
safeguarding the divine gift:
Moreover, knowing that the human power of free will could in-
cline both ways, and anticipating this, he made the grace given to 
them secure by a law and a place. For he led them into his paradise 
and gave them a law, so that if they guarded the grace and re-
mained good, they would retain the life of paradise, without sor-
row, pain, or trouble, along with the promise of incorruption in 
heaven. But if they transgressed and turned away and became evil, 
then they would know that they would suffer in death the corrup-
tion consistent with their nature and would no longer live in para-
dise but in future they would die outside it and remain in death 
and corruption. 30 In light of this passage, it is justiﬁ able to speak of the place of the “law” 
of death in Athanasius’s conception as a divinely instituted symbol and, 
as it were, a compass of humanity’s relation to God. That relation is 
radically constituted by divine gift, and the law is meant to secure this 
gift by manifesting to the human will the two radical options available 
to it: either adherence to the gift through obedience to the divine com-
mandment, or rejection of the gift through disobedience, in which case 
the transgression of the law manifests humanity’s decline from partici-
pation in divine life and lapse into nothingness.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=48

tual framework, the “debt” incurred by radical human transgression 
turns out to be not so much an affront to divine honor, as in the 
Anselmian satisfaction theory, but a rejection of the gift of the divine 
loan of being and well-being. It should be explicable by now why the notion of humanity’s debt 
is never correlated by Athanasius with the terminology of punishment. If Christ’s death is salviﬁ c, it is not by a repayment of the debt through
40 Khaled Anatolios
his undergoing punishment. Rather, the primary category used by 
Athanasius to speak of the salviﬁ c efﬁ cacy of Christ’s death is that of 
“offering,” as that notion is employed in the Letter to the Hebrews. 31 
Again evoking eucharistic overtones, Athanasius repeatedly makes the 
point that human death is reversed when Christ makes an “offering” or 
“sacriﬁ ce” of his own body. 32 If Christ’s death is “in behalf of all,” that is 
not merely a matter of his being a substitute victim of divine wrath, but 
rather a matter of his ability to incorporate all of us into his stance of 
self-offering. This understanding can be gleaned from the way that 
Athanasius correlates the categories of “death for all” and “offering 
for all”: The death of all was fulﬁ lled in the Lord’s body, and death and cor-
ruption were obliterated because of the Word who was united with 
it. For death was necessary and it was needful that there be death 
on behalf of all in order that the debt owed by all might be repaid. Therefore, as I said before, the Word himself, inasmuch as he could 
not die, for he was immortal, took to himself a body which could 
die so that he may offer it as his own on behalf of all.33",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=49

“debt” and “repayment” in light of the text before us and not through 
the anachronistic lens of some later atonement theory. We have already 
seen that the “debt” is really an ontological one that is incurred when 
humanity declines the gift of participation in divine life, while “repay-
ment” is here understood in terms of Christ’s self-offering. Following 
the logic of the Letter to the Hebrews, Athanasius understands this 
 offering on behalf of all not in terms of being a “substitute victim” 
but, more positively, as the opening up of a passageway into the di-
vine realm. “Self-offering” is here understood not primarily as self- 
immolation but as re-entrance into communion with the divine: “For it 
was not the Word himself who needed the opening of the gates . . . . We 
were the one who needed this and he carried [anepheren] us up through 
his own body. For as he offered it to death on behalf of all, so through 
it he again prepared the way into heaven.”34
We are now in a position to bring to Athanasius’s understanding of 
Christ’s death Rahner’s challenge of explicating “the connection be-
Athanasius’s Christology Today 41
tween the incarnate Logos and his function as the mediator of salva-
tion.”35 Simply put, for Athanasius, Christ’s death is a reversal of our 
death. Such a statement is conventionally understood as signifying the 
result of Christ’s death (i.e., Christ’s death leads to the overcoming of 
human death) but needs to be more radically interpreted as applying to 
the very form of Christ’s death: Christ, as it were, changes the direction 
of human death by reorienting even the annihilation of death God-
ward. Our death is the actualization of our natural propensity to lapse 
into the abyss of nothingness when we decline the gift of God’s life- 
sustaining grace.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=50

were the one who needed this and he carried [anepheren] us up through 
his own body. For as he offered it to death on behalf of all, so through 
it he again prepared the way into heaven.”34
We are now in a position to bring to Athanasius’s understanding of 
Christ’s death Rahner’s challenge of explicating “the connection be-
Athanasius’s Christology Today 41
tween the incarnate Logos and his function as the mediator of salva-
tion.”35 Simply put, for Athanasius, Christ’s death is a reversal of our 
death. Such a statement is conventionally understood as signifying the 
result of Christ’s death (i.e., Christ’s death leads to the overcoming of 
human death) but needs to be more radically interpreted as applying to 
the very form of Christ’s death: Christ, as it were, changes the direction 
of human death by reorienting even the annihilation of death God-
ward. Our death is the actualization of our natural propensity to lapse 
into the abyss of nothingness when we decline the gift of God’s life- 
sustaining grace. With this decline comes a “debt” that amounts to 
nothing less than ontological insolvency; our credit line of being and 
well-being goes into the red, as it were. Christ repays our debt inas-
much as the movement of our withdrawal from God is reversed by the 
movement of his self-offering into which we are incorporated and 
through which we enter again into the divine realm. In the biblical 
idiom, a “sacriﬁ ce” or “offering” is a gift that accompanies or symbol-
izes one’s entrance before the Sovereign Lord.36 Applying this notion to 
Athanasius’s understanding of the salviﬁ c efﬁ cacy of Christ’s death, we 
can say that through Christ’s self-giving on our behalf and his extension 
to us of this posture of self-giving through our communion with him, 
our refusal of the gift of divine life is reversed to the point of our receiv-
ing this gift and responding to it with our own gift of ourselves to God 
through Christ. Through death, Christ enters into the extreme limit of 
humanity’s withdrawal from God and reverses this withdrawal by 
making it a gift-offering to the Father. The Salvific Value of Christ’s Resurrection
For Rahner, as we have seen, grasping the signiﬁ cance of the resurrec-
tion of Christ is consequent upon seeing his death in its stark reality as 
the annihilation of Jesus’ human identity and his experience of utter 
God-forsakeness. Jesus’ resurrection is the divine reversal of this limit 
point of human failure. The risen Jesus is manifest as the divine Word 
precisely inasmuch as he embodies the victorious and unsurpassable 
 utterance of God when the utterance of human existence has been ex-
tinguished:

52,"The Salvific Value of Christ’s Resurrection
For Rahner, as we have seen, grasping the signiﬁ cance of the resurrec-
tion of Christ is consequent upon seeing his death in its stark reality as 
the annihilation of Jesus’ human identity and his experience of utter 
God-forsakeness. Jesus’ resurrection is the divine reversal of this limit 
point of human failure. The risen Jesus is manifest as the divine Word 
precisely inasmuch as he embodies the victorious and unsurpassable 
 utterance of God when the utterance of human existence has been ex-
tinguished:
42 Khaled Anatolios This word has been uttered in the death and resurrection of Jesus. It is deﬁ nitive because after death no history continues and no new 
possibilities offer themselves. But it is irrevocable because in death, 
if it is really taken seriously, only God can offer himself unless 
nothingness is to engulf us. Jesus was cruciﬁ ed and is risen into the 
incomprehensible darkness of God. This means that he is the Word 
of God to us, not simply a word. But if in this Word-for-us God 
promises himself to us irrevocably, then that Word has a unique re-
lationship to God himself. 37 
Elsewhere, Rahner explains that the encounter of the believing Chris-
tian with the risen Christ is radically structured by the transcendental 
hope of resurrection that is native to human subjectivity. 38 Every human 
subject seeks assurance of the “abiding validity” of his existence, not 
merely in its physical embodiment but also in its meaningfulness. From 
the perspective of religious experience, such assurance seeks the accep-
tance and afﬁ rmation of one’s existence by God. The kerygma of the 
risen Jesus provides the possibility of such assurance inasmuch as it 
claims for Jesus this absolute afﬁ rmation. This kerygma raises the exis-
tentially crucial question “of whether this transcendental hope in resur-
rection is still simply looking in history to see whether it can encounter 
a risen one, or whether he ‘already’ exists and as such can be experi-
enced in faith.”39 The afﬁ rmation of the latter claim stakes its founda-
tion on the apostolic preaching as well as on the personal experience of 
the risen Christ in the Spirit, both of which are experienced as mani-
festing an inner correspondence “between transcendental hope in resur-
rection and the categorical and real presence of such a resurrection.”40 The appeal to transcendental structures of human subjectivity is 
obviously not within the ken of Athanasius. Yet, with regard to his ex-
plication of Christ’s resurrection, as in other aspects of his christological 
thinking, it will not do to reduce his Christology to a merely “vertical” 
Christology of incarnational descent.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=52

Christology of incarnational descent. Indeed, it is not too far-fetched to 
suggest that Rahner’s recourse to the dialectical correspondence be-
tween transcendental hope and categorical claims to fulﬁ llment of this 
hope is substantially paralleled in Athanasius’s method of correlating 
Christology with a theology of creation. At the beginning of On the
Athanasius’s Christology Today 43
 Incarnation, Athanasius signals the centrality of this strategy to his ar-
gument: “As we embark on our exposition, it is appropriate for us to 
begin by speaking of the creation of the universe and of God, its 
 Creator.”41 A little later, as his theology of creation focuses on theologi-
cal anthropology, Athanasius once again asserts his method: “Perhaps 
you are wondering why we are now dealing with the origin of hu-
manity when we proposed to speak about the incarnation of the Word. But this is not outside the scope of our exposition. ”42 Clearly, Athana-
sius himself is pursuing a strategy of explicating the intelligibility of the 
message of Christ in terms of an inner correspondence. But in place of 
an inner correspondence between transcendental and categorical expe-
rience, we have in On the Incarnation an attempt to depict an inner cor-
respondence on the level of narrative, between the stories of creation 
and redemption. Yet, within this narrative mode, the reader is led to an 
encounter with substantially the same inner realities that Rahner hopes 
to expose with his transcendental perspective: that humanity is or-
dained to immortality and a secure participation in the life of God. In 
the very telling of the story of human creation in these terms, Athana-
sius is evoking precisely the transcendental hope of which Rahner 
speaks. Conversely, in Athanasius’s telling, all the counterevidence in 
human history and experience to this reality is summed up in the cate-
gory of “corruption,” humanity’s decline from its original participation 
in divine life.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=53

as the reversal of that corruption: Christ brings corruption to an end 
by the “grace of the resurrection.”43 Through his juxtaposition of nar-
ratives of creation and redemption, Athanasius thus depicts the non- 
correspondence between the human aspiration to fullness of life (par-
ticipation in the divine) and the tragedies of the human condition as 
overcome through the resurrection of Christ. What are the indications of this overcoming? In the essay by Rah-
ner that is the immediate focus of our attention, this question is not 
broached. Elsewhere, Rahner points to the inner witness of the Spirit 
as the nexus between the transcendental hope of resurrection and the 
 categorical claims of the gospel. 44 Athanasius’s On the Incarnation largely 
abstracts from reﬂ ection on the work of the Spirit, though this lacuna 
is ﬁ lled elsewhere. But in this work, there is another intriguing and
44 Khaled Anatolios
 challenging depiction of the reasons for hope in the resurrection of 
Christ, and that is the living witness of the church. This witness is de-
picted not so much in terms of a deliberate proclamation ad extra as it is 
in terms of the inner vitality of the members of the church and the evi-
dence of the transformation of their lives: For if it is true that someone who is dead is not active but the  
Savior acts in so many ways every day, drawing people to piety, 
persuading to virtue, teaching immortality, instilling desire for 
heavenly things, revealing knowledge of the Father, implanting 
power against death, showing himself to each one . . . whom then 
can be said to be dead? Christ who acts in all these ways? But it 
does not belong to the dead to be active . . . . For the Son of God 
is “alive and active” and works every day, effecting the salvation 
of all.45",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=54

daring and fragile in Athanasius’s own time as it is in ours. Then as 
now, the community of Christ’s disciples manifested not only a witness 
of luminous transformation but also many of the features of the human 
condition that Athanasius refers to as “corruption.” The “Arian contro-
versy,” in which Athanasius was embroiled, gives ample evidence of 
this. But the essential point in Athanasius’s discourse is not the indefecti-
bility of the church, as if there were merely a simple continuity between 
the risen Christ and the church, but rather the witness that there are 
some within this community who manifest a transformation whose 
agency must be attributed to the living God. Since this transformation 
is undertaken in the name of the cruciﬁ ed Jesus, it is he who is the liv-
ing God and divine Word. What concerns us here is not so much the 
apologetic efﬁ cacy or logical consistency of this argument as the combi-
nation of theological reasoning and existential application. Far from a 
merely Platonic and ontological Christology of descent, what we have 
here is the positing of a strict correlation, at least in principle, between 
Jesus’ risen life and its concrete manifestation in the church. The reali-
zation of this correlation in fact remains the task of an existential Chris-
tology incumbent upon every disciple of the risen Christ. Athanasius’s Christology Today 45

Having outlined the “functional” aspects of Athanasius’s understand-
ing of the mystery of Christ in terms of his conception of the salviﬁ c 
meaning of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, we are now in a position 
to adopt Rahner’s suggestion that the principles of “classical Christol-
ogy” need to be rearticulated in a contemporary idiom. The following 
are ten theses that recapitulate some of the fundamental features of 
Athanasius’s classical On the Incarnation:

and risen Jesus is unqualiﬁ edly the Word of God and thus, God.46

1. The heart of the Christian faith is the afﬁ rmation that the cruciﬁ ed 
and risen Jesus is unqualiﬁ edly the Word of God and thus, God.46 
2. The central task for the proclamation of this message in the mode 
of reasoned discourse (theology) is to make intelligible the plausi-
bility of this assertion that the cruciﬁ ed Jesus is God: “so that from 
the apparent abasement of the Word your piety toward him may be 
enlarged and multiplied.”47
3.  The construction of the plausibility of this assertion involves ac-
counts of an “inner correspondence” between human experience 
and the message of the gospel (creation and redemption). Such an 
account involves claims about human capacity, human incapacity, 
and God’s afﬁ rmation of human capacity and reversal of human 
incapacity. This divine work is salvation. 4.  The Christian account of human capacity posits the human being 
as capax dei: in Athanasius’s terms, ordained to participation in di-
vine life; in Rahnerian terms, having an obediential potency and a 
transcendental hope for resurrection. 5.  The Christian account of human incapacity adopts a perspective of 
tragic realism in an unﬂ inching awareness of the degradation of 
human life, whose absolute and universally inescapable limit is the 
annihilation of death. 6.  The Christian account of the saving God claims that God takes re-
sponsibility for the ﬂ ourishing of human capacity and the reversal 
of human incapacity because of his sovereign love and the honor of 
his own glory. 48

the “works” and “signs” of his earthly life, through his partaking of 
the annihilation of human death, and through his transformation 
of the content of death from being a withdrawal from divine life to 
being a self-offering to God. The fulﬁ llment of this reversal is the 
resurrection of Christ. 8.  Jesus, as the unqualiﬁ ed and absolute Word of God, manifests his

sentially involves a corporate (ecclesial) experience of the reversal

failure to speak of Christ’s human soul in this treatise. Focus on this issue can be 
explained by a doubly anachronistic projection onto Athanasius’s texts: that of 
the problematic of Apollinarius, who denied that Christ had a human soul, and 
that of a later analytical christological perspective preoccupied with the onto-
logical composition of the person of the God-Man. The latter approach domi-
nates the highly inﬂ uential presentation of the issue by Alois Grillmeier, who 
also gives an overview of the pertinent scholarship (Christ in Christian Tradition, 
2nd ed., vol. 1, From the Apostolic Age to Chalcedon (451), trans. John Bowden 
[Atlanta: John Knox Press, 1975], 308–28). There are three reasons that can help 
explain Athanasius’s neglecting to mention the human soul of Christ: ﬁ rst, 
Athanasius is more concerned with how the relation between God and creation 
is changed by Christ than with analyzing how Jesus’ humanity and divinity ﬁ t 
together; second, precisely for that reason, he emphasizes the extremes united in 
Jesus (the Word and the body) rather than an analysis of how these extremes are 
mediated (e.g., by a human soul). (On these two points, cf. K. Anatolios, Athana-
sius: The Coherence of His Thought [London: Routledge, 2004], 67–78, 127–28.) And third, the doctrine of Christ’s human soul had at that time been problema-
tized because of its associations both with the teaching of Paul of Samosata, who 
was reported to have held that Jesus Christ was a “mere man,” and with Ori-
gen’s doctrine of the preexistence of souls. (Cf. R. Williams, Arius: Heresy and 
Tradition, rev. ed. [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2002], 176.) Athanasius might well 
have thought it best to set aside these questions. An important hermeneutical 
principle to observe in this context is that we have to limit ourselves to the text 
as it stands, in which the human soul of Christ is neither afﬁ rmed nor denied.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=58

ecent scholarship on patristic commentaries of the Psalms empha-
   sizes the close correspondence between the exegetical method and 
the theological vision of the author. Karen Jo Torjesen, for instance, 
notes that Origen regarded exegesis as Christian paideia.1 For this an-
cient Alexandrian, the interpretation of a psalm renders Christ present 
by transposing the reader into the world of the psalm, so that, from re-
pentance through divinization, “the experiences of the Psalmist become 
[the reader’s own] experiences.”2 To a person thus placed imaginatively 
and affectively within the Word of God, Christ the Word addresses 
himself. A similar dynamic prevails in the thinking of many fourth- 
and ﬁ fth-century commentators on the Psalms. Because of the regular 
use of Psalms in Christian worship, their centrality in ascetical prac-
tices, and their general accessibility as prayers to be memorized, recited, 
50

or sung, exegetes viewed the Psalter as uniquely situated among books 
of the Bible. Ancient Christians could appropriate verses so easily into 
their own lives. Augustine’s early-ﬁ fth-century exhortation to his own 
congregation exempliﬁ es an attitude we ﬁ nd in many writers, who em-
phasize that reciting the Psalms with understanding constitutes an ac-
tual participation in the Word: “If the Psalm is praying, pray yourselves; 
if it is groaning, you groan too; if it is happy, rejoice; if it is crying out in 
hope, you hope as well; if it expresses fear, be afraid. Everything written 
here is like a mirror held up to us.”3 The perceived ease, therefore, with which early Christians might 
link a psalm’s verses to their own experience makes early exegesis of the 
Psalms an interesting case study for investigating how patristic com-
mentators understood Scripture in a theological sense: how, that is, they 
conceived Scripture operating as the Word of God at a particular mo-
ment in the history of the church or in the life of an individual Chris-
tian. In his frequently quoted Letter to Marcellinus, for instance, Atha-
nasius observes that a person reads the words of the Psalms immediately 
“as one’s own words” and that they possess a therapeutic quality for 
every psychic malady.4 As medicine, the Psalms recreate the interior 
image of God within a person in a manner that corresponds to the sal-
vation effected by the Word’s becoming ﬂ esh.5",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=61

image of God within a person in a manner that corresponds to the sal-
vation effected by the Word’s becoming ﬂ esh.5 When commenting on 
the Psalter, therefore, the exegete places himself within that process of 
redemption. Thus Brian Daley notes that, for the early church, to ex-
pound upon the Psalms was not simply to explain Scripture as an exte-
rior phenomenon. Rather, “it was to draw the mind of the believer 
more deeply into the process by which the Word of God, working in 
the deep recesses of the human heart and mind, continues to restore the 
harmony and health of creation.”6 To speak of the restoration of creation, however, particularly in late 
ancient Christianity, implies the expectancy of an eschatological con-
summation. Here I will argue that such anticipation of ﬁ nal things con-
stitutes a crucial index of how exegetes treated the Psalms as Scripture. If an interpreter intends to transpose the reader into the world of a 
psalm, wherein Christ, the Word, speaks, then the horizons of such a 
world will ﬁ x the boundaries of its meaning. For patristic writers, the 
Psalms did not simply provide locutions for healing present maladies

but offered a future orientation. 7 Although early Christian commenta-
tors regarded the Psalms as prophecy whose fulﬁ llment lies in the per-
son of Christ, not everything in Scripture had yet been completely 
fulﬁ lled. Expositors of the Psalms remained deeply conscious that his-
tory had not come to a close and that the full scope of Scripture’s prom-
ise extended to some point in the future. The return of Christ, judgment, 
the ﬁ nal transformation, and the handing over of the kingdom to the 
Father form the outermost frame of the narrative wherein patristic 
writers interpreted the Psalms.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=62

stance, would explain the rather odd translation of Psalm 127:2 (“You 
will eat the labors of your fruits [Labores fructuum tuorum manduca-
bis]”) by suggesting a textual emendation, Hilary of Poitiers explains 
the verse by placing it against the horizon of eternity. While on earth, 
he says, you must do good works of mercy, patience, and chastity to 
nourish your soul. “The fruit of these labors is in eternity, but here the 
labor of eternal fruits must ﬁ rst be eaten.”8 Such an eschatological framework so deeply informs Hilary’s the-
ology that it largely determines his exegesis. His Tractatus super Psal-
mos, most likely written in the ﬁ nal years of his own life (ca. 365) and 
representing “the fruits of a grand doctrinal effort,”9 dwells on the be-
atitude to be gained by reﬂ ecting on the Psalms. Yet Hilary tends to 
defer the realization of blessedness to the future life. If the beatus uir of 
Psalm 1 is the person who strives to be conformed to Christ, such con-
formation is necessarily incomplete. “The fact that he has not walked in 
the counsel of the wicked,” says Hilary, “nor stood in the way of sinners 
nor sat in the seat of pestilence does not yet [nondum] consummate the 
blessedness of the man.”10 This eschatological consummation obtains 
only when he has arrived among the saints, who have put off the cor-
ruption of ﬂ esh and blood. In Hilary’s ﬁ nal words on Psalm 150, he re-
fers to the proper end of human beings as the eternal praise of God. “They have been reformed into the image of their creator,” he says, “be-
cause they have begun to be conformed to the glory of God’s body, 
 because they are ﬁ lled with every fulness of God.”11

cal framework within which one interprets the Psalms will have a 
unique efﬁ cacy in the lives of those who try to make those verses their 
own. Many ancient commentators, for instance, showed deep interest 
in the order or sequencing of the Psalms as itself signiﬁ cant, as itself re-
ﬂ ecting the gradual restoration and ultimate reformation of creation. A 
decade after Hilary, Gregory of Nyssa notes that there is a “natural and 
necessary order which progressively achieves that which is pursued. ”12 
As a sculptor does not begin a work “at once with the end,” so the Word 
hews us and carves us methodically and orderly so as to arrive at the 
end of forming the divine likeness in us.13 Gregory’s interest in the 
order and aim of a work may reﬂ ect ancient grammatical concerns, but 
it also foreshadows the insights of literary theorists on the dynamics of 
narrative. For such theorists, logical relations among elements of a nar-
rative give meaning to the whole, and it is usually within a temporal se-
quence of events that one seeks understanding. As Paul Ricoeur notes: 
“time becomes human time to the extent that it is organized after the 
manner of a narrative; narrative, in turn, is meaningful to the extent 
that it portrays the features of temporal experience.”14 
When a Christian author such as Hilary, then, takes a non- 
narrative genre such as the Psalms and places them against the larger 
Christian narrative pointing toward the ﬁ nal transformation of the 
world, he situates the reader of the Psalms within a sequencing pattern 
that has not yet achieved closure. Only such closure, however, will give 
the Psalms their full meaning. From the very beginning of his Tractatus 
super Psalmos, Hilary explicitly sets the Psalter within an eschatological 
horizon that is crucial to his understanding of what Scripture is 
and does.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=64

general commentary on the Psalter as a whole. He begins this Instructio 
Psalmorum by arguing that the Psalms form a unity as a book. Although 
other writers want to divide the Psalms into ﬁ ve books or treat them 
simply as discrete, individual “Psalms of David,” Hilary follows  Origen
54 Michael C. McCarthy, S.J.
in ﬁ nding authority in Peter’s reference in the Acts of the Apostles to a 
single book of Psalms (Acts 1:20).15 Therefore “it is more rightly called 
a ‘book of Psalms,’” says Hilary, “with different prophesies of different 
people and authors and times gathered into one volume.”16 Yet the 
principle of this unity among the Psalms remains its inspiration by the 
Holy Spirit, who intends the understanding of the total Christian nar-
rative: “Without doubt what is said in the Psalms must be understood 
according to the proclamation of the Gospel, so that in whatever per-
sona the spirit of prophecy speaks, it refers as a whole to the under-
standing of the glory and power of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
his incarnation, his passion, his kingdom, and our resurrection.”17 The 
Psalter’s classiﬁ cation as a single book, therefore, depends on its future 
orientation and sense of narrative progression from Christ’s coming to 
Christ’s glory and our ﬁ nal resurrection. Such progression is essential to 
understanding what Hilary calls the whole weaving of types and alle-
gories in the Psalms.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=65

believers together gloriﬁ ed with him and judging the rest.”18 The same 
expectation of Christ’s future rule and of the gloriﬁ cation of believers 
with him appears throughout the Tractatus super Psalmos as a key to 
Hil ary’s interpretation. Like so many patristic commentators on the Psalter, Hilary notes 
that the psalms are ordered, not in historical sequence, but so that the 
virtue and mystery of the number may perfect each psalm in their mu-
tual arrangement. 19 So, for instance, while historically David’s peniten-
tial prayer in Psalm 50 comes after the episode related in the inscription 
to Psalm 51, referring to Doeg the Edomite, the actual order in the 
Psalter places the psalm about the remission of sins before the psalm

sion.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=66

sion. By Psalm 51, “both the time and the number of penance had been 
lost,” says Hilary, for the number ﬁ fty, as a “sabbath of sabbaths” or the 
number of the jubilee year, corresponds to the remission of sins.20 
Roughly a decade after Hilary’s work, Gregory of Nyssa repeats virtu-
ally the same point when he notes that the “spiritual Word [logos pneu-
matikos]” in Psalm 50, not being concerned about chronological order,
Expectatio Beatitudinis 55
contains the “antidote given for the destruction of the adversary . . . the 
antidote of repentance.”21 The similarity in explanation may well de-
rive from a common dependence on Origen. Although Hilary does not include in his introduction a thorough 
discussion of sequence among individual psalms, he does divide the 
book into three parts whose trajectory clearly represents a progression 
of stages to an eschatological consummation. “The book,” he says, “is 
contained in three groups of ﬁ fty Psalms; and this is so in relation and 
proportion to that expectation of our blessedness.”22 Such reference to 
relation and proportion (ex ratione ac numero) may faintly echo the har-
monic theory we ﬁ nd more explicitly in Athanasius. 23 What is most 
striking in this passage, however, is how the theme of eschatological 
fulﬁ llment dominates Hilary’s conception of the Psalter as a whole: For whoever pays close attention to the consummation of the ﬁ rst 
ﬁ fty and then the second ﬁ fty and again the third ﬁ fty, in which is 
the end of the book, will understand that the providence of Psalms 
arranged in this order matches the dispensation of our salvation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=67

proportion to that expectation of our blessedness.”22 Such reference to

ﬁ fty and then the second ﬁ fty and again the third ﬁ fty, in which is 
the end of the book, will understand that the providence of Psalms 
arranged in this order matches the dispensation of our salvation. For since the ﬁ rst step to salvation consists in being reborn into a 
new man after the remission of sins, and the step after the confes-
sion of one’s repentance consists in serving the Lord’s kingdom 
until the time of that holy city and heavenly Jerusalem, and after 
that, with celestial glory having been consummated in us, we pro-
ceed through the kingdom of the Son into the kingdom of God the 
Father, in which the whole universe of spirits will proclaim the 
praises owed to God, we will easily understand that the mystery of 
this arrangement in ﬁ fty is contained in the individual virtues of 
the Psalms collected under the number ﬁ fty. 24
Each psalm, then, somehow moves us from repentance to the expecta-
tion of eschatological fulﬁ llment. At the very end of the Tractatus Hil-
ary repeats this division in his brief commentary on Psalm 150, where 
he notes that psalms reﬂ ect the step-by-step approach into communion 
with God (gradatim per hoc ad dei consortium ueniretur), moving through 
baptism, resurrection, and ﬁ nal transformation of one’s nature, where 
one may enjoy the consummation of glory.25
56 Michael C. McCarthy, S.J. The prevalence of this eschatological vision is even more pro-
nounced in Hilary’s discussion of the ogdoad as a kind of organizing 
principle of the Psalter. Like Origen and many other patristic exegetes, 
the number eight signiﬁ es both the ﬁ nal transformation of creation as 
well as the practice of Christian worship on the “Eighth Day” of the 
week, whereon they celebrated the resurrection as the ﬁ rst day of their 
new creation. 26 Most interpreters of Psalm 6, for instance, with its in-
scription “for the eighth,” ﬁ nd in it various kinds of eschatological sig-
niﬁ cance. 27 In the Instructio Psalmorum, however, Hilary has a far more 
extensive discussion of how the Psalter itself, not just the sixth psalm, 
comports with the ogdoad.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=68

extensive discussion of how the Psalter itself, not just the sixth psalm, 
comports with the ogdoad. After giving the usual explanation of the 
ogdoad as that day when, according to the fulness of the Gospel (secun-
dum euangelicam plenitudinem), Christians would celebrate in complete 
beatitude the fulﬁ llment of time, he turns to the three psalms that bear 
the inscription “for the presses”: It is worthwhile to reﬂ ect upon this virtue of the ogdoad, perfect 
with heavenly mysteries, placed eighth in number, to which the 
title “for the presses” has been added, that is, vessels prepared for 
new fruit and made new for containing the heat of seething juice. That number has been ﬁ xed in accordance with the evangelical og-
doad, for collecting the fruits of the Gospel, when these corruptible 
vessels of our bodies have been reformed. The text and language of 
this Psalm bears witness. 28
The very pattern of the Psalter underscores the anticipation of ﬁ nal 
consummation in the Trinity: “For the eighth and eightieth and eighty-
third Psalms have this title [‘for the presses’], so that in perfect numbers 
the order of this perfect beatitude may be present to the extent that the 
mystery of the triad, which we call Trinity, may complete the simple 
ogdoad and the decade of the ogdoad.”29
Hilary sees in the lengthy Psalm 118 the perfection of the ogdoad, 
both in meaning and form, since it comprises twenty-two sets of eight 
verses, one for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Thus Hilary argues 
that Psalm 118 brings to completion the perfect man according to the 
teaching of the Gospel (Psalmus iste perfectum uirum secundum doctri-
Expectatio Beatitudinis 57
nam euangelicam consummat).30 Immediately after Psalm 118, however,

accomplishment of the Gospel, which is perfected both in our present 
religion and in the hoped-for expectation of the ogdoad, one ascends in 
the song of the steps to heavenly and eternal things. ”31 By attending to 
this song of ﬁ fteen steps, Hilary notes, the number of the hebdomad 
and the ogdoad together, one will be placed among the perfect, the 
blessed, and the holy of holies. At several points in his introductory instruction on the Psalms, 
Hil ary indicates that the purpose of the Psalter is to lead a soul ﬁ nally 
to this state of blessedness. In his discussion of the inscription “unto the 
end,” such a concern is particularly obvious. In a passage that bears 
rather close literary parallels to Origen, Hilary writes: The end is that on account of which other things exist; the end it-
self, however, existing on account of nothing else, provides its own 
cause. For all things exist on account of an end; nothing else exists 
beyond that end. For things tend toward an end but they reach 
their destination in an end. So the end is both the completion of 
what comes before it and is itself the proper possession of itself, 
since it puts forth from itself nothing for the sake of something else.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=70

cause. For all things exist on account of an end; nothing else exists 
beyond that end. For things tend toward an end but they reach 
their destination in an end. So the end is both the completion of 
what comes before it and is itself the proper possession of itself, 
since it puts forth from itself nothing for the sake of something else. Therefore the Psalms that are inscribed “unto the end” must be un-
derstood as consisting of perfect and absolute doctrines of eternal 
goods, as well as of hopes, because the course of our faith extends 
itself to those things taught in these doctrines, and in these, with no 
further advance, in the same end of beatitude hoped for and at-
tained, it ﬁ nds rest.32 As for many patristic commentators, the title “to the end” reﬂ ects the 
summary of all Christian teaching. Half a century later, Augustine re-
peats in many of his sermons that the title “unto the end” refers to 
Christ as the end of the law, not in the sense of ﬁ nishing it off but 
of bringing it to perfection. 33 Hilary’s own explanation of the end,
58 Michael C. McCarthy, S.J.
 however, bears greater resemblance to Origen’s understanding of the 
aim (skopos) or end (telos) of Scripture as the “connection that exists 
among spiritual events, those that have already happened and those 
that are yet to come to pass. ”34 Gregory of Nyssa appropriates this idea 
in his own treatment of the Psalms. Gregory identiﬁ es the end or aim 
of the Psalter with the end of the virtuous life, which is beatitude.35 He 
thus explains the inscription “unto the end” as the prophet’s showing us 
the ﬁ nal rewards of our labors in the virtuous life, “so that, by looking 
to the ‘end,’ you might entrust yourself to ‘the one who gives victory’ 
and procure the announcement ‘of victory’ for yourself. ”36
That Hilary in his general instruction consistently places the Psalms 
within the horizon of ﬁ nal things conﬁ rms the importance of his theo-
logical vision to his practice of exegesis. But the clear eschatological 
frame also stresses what literary theorists tell us about the importance 
of closure for the coherence of any narrative. Expectations built into a 
narrative must be satisﬁ ed by the end.37",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=71

mode notes that people in the middle of events “make considerable 
imaginative investments in coherent patterns which, by the provision 
of an end, make possible a satisfying consonance with the origins and 
with the middle. ”38 Throughout his commentary on the Psalms, Hil ary 
locates this coherence in the progressive divinization of humanity 
through the person of Christ. But the “end” for Hilary is always at some 
point hereafter. Such divinization is only complete when all things are 
conformed to Christ’s gloriﬁ ed body and brought into eternal commu-
nion in the kingdom of the Father. The expectation of blessedness ﬁ nds 
satisfaction only with that ultimate closure. Tractates on Psalms 1 and 2
Although Hilary agrees with other Christian exegetes that the whole of 
the Book of Psalms must refer to Christ, he differs from those who say 
that the “happy man” of Psalm 1 must describe Christ.39 The opening 
words of the Psalter, “Happy is the man who . . . ,” suggest the process 
of growth into blessedness, which cannot be predicated of Eternal Wis-
dom itself, existing before the ages. Here Hilary draws an important
Expectatio Beatitudinis 59
contrast between God’s constant existence and creation’s formation into 
the fulness of existence. “That which will be through the expectation of 
some future time, cannot be seen either as having been nor as being al-
ready in the nature of things.”40 Accordingly, Hilary argues that the 
blessed man of the ﬁ rst psalm is one who understands his own life in 
terms of cultivating a future perfection. We must interpret the whole 
psalm as referring to one who “strives to conform himself to that body 
which the Lord assumed and in which He was born as a human man, 
with eagerness for justice and perfect fulﬁ llment of all righteousness.”41 
The whole Psalter, it seems, is composed precisely to help weak people 
hope for a ﬁ nal beatitude by indicating the whole scope of salvation. In

pose, he writes:",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=72

The whole Psalter, it seems, is composed precisely to help weak people 
hope for a ﬁ nal beatitude by indicating the whole scope of salvation. In 
a brief passage that suggests Hilary’s understanding of the Psalms’ pur-
pose, he writes: The Holy Spirit takes up this most beautiful and worthy beginning 
of the Psalms, so as to stir up human weakness through hope of be-
atitude to the pursuit of blameless piety, to teach him the mystery 
of God Incarnate [sacramentum dei corporati], to promise partici-
pation in heavenly glory, to announce the penalty of judgement, to 
show the two kinds of resurrection, to show the providence of God 
in just rewards. 42
Hilary also notes that the prophecy of the Psalms is set forth in “perfect 
and complete design [perfecta consummataque ratione]” so that the reader 
will cultivate the hope of the blessed man in eschatological fulﬁ llment. 43 On the verse “his will is in the Law of the Lord, and on the law shall he 
meditate day and night,” Hilary stresses that such constant meditation 
forms the will for the attainment of perfect happiness, wherein one is 
conformed to God.44 Although Hilary’s language throughout the trac-
tates hints at an Eastern model of salvation as divinization,45 prior to 
the fulﬁ llment of time, one advances only in the “expectation of bless-
edness.” Thus Hilary interprets the verse “He shall be like a tree planted 
beside ﬂ ows of water, which shall yield fruit in due season and whose 
leaf shall never fade.” The tree itself is the Tree of Life, to which the 
blessed man will be assimilated. The due season of yielding fruit comes 
after a delay in time (mora temporis). “For the dispensation of giving 
fruit,” he says, “waits upon the fulness of time.”46 And what is the fruit? 60 Michael C. McCarthy, S.J.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=73

after a delay in time (mora temporis). “For the dispensation of giving 
fruit,” he says, “waits upon the fulness of time.”46 And what is the fruit? 60 Michael C. McCarthy, S.J. The transformation of our vile body (as Philippians says) into confor-
mity with his own glorious body in the resurrection: 
Therefore, Christ will give us his fruits, which he has perfected in 
that one he has assumed to himself and who is signiﬁ ed in that tree, 
the one he has transfused into the nature of his own immortality, 
with his mortality having been absorbed. Thus will the blessed 
man be as this tree, when he himself shall stand conformed to his 
Lord in the glory of God.47
So too Hilary reads the verse “whatever he does shall prosper.” By vir-
tue of Christ’s passion, he avers, “whatever happens in us is eternal and 
eternal with an awareness of beatitude [aeternum cum beatitudinis sensu], 
since we will ourselves be like the tree of life . . . for incorruption will 
swallow corruption, eternity inﬁ rmity, and the form of God the form of 
this earthly ﬂ esh.”48
Hilary’s exegesis of Psalm 2 relates the blessed man’s eternal beati-
tude even more directly to its christological context. Because the Acts of 
the Apostles quotes this psalm, Hilary, like many other Christian exe-
getes, claims clear apostolic authority for relating it to the person of 
Christ, especially verses 6–7: “I have been established by him as king 
over Mount Zion, announcing his decree. The Lord said, ‘You are my 
Son, today I have begotten you.’” Although Hilary notes that the day of 
begetting must be an eternal day before all time,49 he also declares that 
the Son’s establishment as king over Zion refers to an eschatological re-
ality made possible only by the temporal dispensation of the incarna-
tion, resurrection, and bodily gloriﬁ cation: “Because he was Son of God 
before and then also Son of man, that which in time is the son of man 
through the power of the resurrection gives birth to the perfect Son of 
God, that is, to regain and bestow to the body the glory of the Son’s own 
eternity, which glory he, in bodily form, claimed from the Father.”50

of the ﬁ nal consummation and the transformation effected in the ﬁ rst-
born from the dead.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=74

of the ﬁ nal consummation and the transformation effected in the ﬁ rst-
born from the dead. “Ask of me,” says the psalm, “and I will give you 
the nations as your heritage, and the ends of the earth for your posses-
sion. You will rule them with an iron rod and dash them as a vessel of 
clay” (vv. 8–9). Throughout this section of his commentary, Hilary’s
Expectatio Beatitudinis 61
chief concern is to show how Christ’s inheritance lies in giving eternal 
life to all ﬂ esh.51 Although many regard these verses as contrary to the 
goodness of God, Hilary emphasizes that Christ’s rule is pastoral, not 
tyrannical,52 and that the dashing of clay vessels refers to the transfor-
mation of our characters through repentance and ultimately our bodies 
in the general resurrection. Quoting the prophet Jeremiah, who speaks 
of God treating Israel as a potter treats his clay (Jer 18:1ff.), Hilary notes 
that God dashes and wears away in order to reform us, so that “after 
our vices, we might live again in virtue.”53 But the breaking up of clay 
vessels must also refer to the refashioning of our bodies into vessels of 
glory: That is understood to be signiﬁ ed which, according to the will of 
God, is the future restoration of risen bodies.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=75

God and is worthy in his sight, he will repair what is broken, not 
from some other thing but from the same old material of its origin, 
imparting upon them the form of beauty pleasing to him, so that 
the resurrection of corruptible bodies into the glory of incorruption 
will not annihilate its nature by dissolution but will change in the 
condition of its quality . . . . Therefore, change occurs, an abolition 
is not applied . . . . So let us rejoice, either now or then, to be broken 
like vessels of clay. 54
Thus Hilary urges the reader of the Psalms to focus on the eschatologi-
cal goal of transformation made possible by virtue of the incarnation 
and resurrection. The note of salvation as a kind of divinization is very 
clear. Because the Son of God has become what we are, says Hilary, 
and taken hold of what we are, let us take a hold of him, so that we 
may  attain the nature of God, with God ﬁ rst attaining the nature of 
 humans. 55
The Eschatological Scope of Divinization 
in TRACTATUS SUPER PSALMOS At least since Emile Mersch’s work on the “Mystical Body of Christ,” 
Hilary’s understanding of redemption has been classiﬁ ed as sharing a
62 Michael C. McCarthy, S.J.
great deal in common with a more Eastern, “physical” model of re-
demption, which emphasizes less the atoning death of Christ than the 
change effected in humanity by virtue of the incarnation. 56 Hilary, 
the “Athanasius of the West,”57 is cited as the ﬁ rst theologian in the 
Western world to suggest an eschatology of “divinization. ” 58 Christ’s 
assumption of human nature begins a process wherein humanity comes 
to be transformed and ﬁ nally shares in God’s immortality, namely, so 
that a human being “may become God.”59 Thus, in his commentary on 
Psalm 91, Hilary notes that we are reconciled in the body of Christ’s 
ﬂ esh: “therefore, through our joining with the ﬂ esh that he assumed, 
we are in Christ.” In Christ we are “coheirs and concorporate and co-
participants in his promise [coheredes et concorporales et conparticipes 
pollicitationis eius].",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=76

participants in his promise [coheredes et concorporales et conparticipes 
pollicitationis eius]. Through its joining with his ﬂ esh, the whole uni-
verse is in Christ.” 60 Christ’s bodily transformation into glory inaugu-
rates the possibility of our own bodily transformation into glory. So, “by 
establishing us in his body, he renovates us into new life and transforms 
us into a new person.”61 Hilary’s contentions follow quite closely the fa-
mous Athanasian dictum that “the Word became human so that we 
may become divine.”62
In places throughout the Tractatus super Psalmos Hilary almost sug-
gests that in the incarnation, the Word itself assumed a universal rather 
than an individual human nature. If that were the case, then diviniza-
tion would appear to result simply from the juxtaposition of humanity 
and divinity in Christ. In his commentary on Psalm 51, for instance, 
Hilary states that the Son of God born from a woman “assumed in him-
self the nature of all ﬂ esh [naturam in se uniuersae carnis adsumpsit]”63 
and that, when the Word became ﬂ esh and dwelt among us, “he surely 
assumed in himself the nature of the human race [scilicet in se totius hu-
mani generis adsumens].”64 In his own ﬁ ne work on divinization accord-
ing to Hilary, Philip T. Wild expresses certain embarrassment not only 
at the suggestion that the Word of God may be incarnate in all human 
persons but also that the transformation of humanity into God is auto-
matically effected by the incarnation. 65 Thus, he distances himself from 
Mersch’s claim that Hilary’s “physical theory” of redemption can be 
separated from his eschatological views. 66 According to Mersch, Hilary
Expectatio Beatitudinis 63
understands our incorporation into Christ to be just as real in this life as 
in the life to come. 67 By contrast, Wild argues that by “universal human 
nature” Hilary means the weaknesses associated with human nature: 
the Word, that is, did not take on a nature unlike ours, but assumed the 
inﬁ rmities associated with the human ﬂ esh without himself becoming 
inﬁ rm.68",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=77

nature” Hilary means the weaknesses associated with human nature: 
the Word, that is, did not take on a nature unlike ours, but assumed the 
inﬁ rmities associated with the human ﬂ esh without himself becoming 
inﬁ rm.68 The human nature that the Word assumes becomes fully di-
vinized with the resurrection of Christ, and those conformed to Christ 
too shall be divinized at their own resurrection. Such divinization, 
however, is not guaranteed to all men and women. In a commentary on 
Christ’s statement that “I am the vine: you are the branches,” Hilary re-
marks that by taking on human nature, the vine contains in himself all 
branches, but a branch that does not bear fruit will be trimmed. 69 So, if 
humanity is changed on account of the incarnation, only faith in the 
vine will yield divinization of an individual. Hilary reveals his sense of the eschatological scope of divinization, 
as well as its connection with Christ’s own resurrection, in his commen-
tary on Psalm 141:8 (“The just shall await me, until you give me my re-
ward”). Prior to the resurrection of the Lord, the faith of the apostles 
wavers, but after his death and resurrection such fear ceases and they 
are secure. So, then, do the just wait until Christ is ultimately given his 
reward by God. And what is that? Exaltation in the glory of God the 
Father: This retribution is given to him by God, so that the eternity of his 
Father’s glory will be given to his body, which he assumed. The 
same is the expectation, however, of the just, as the apostle teaches 
when he says: “Our way of life is in heaven, whence we also expect 
our savior Jesus Christ, who will transform the body of our hu-
mility conformed to the body of his glory” (Phil. 3:20). Therefore 
the just look forward until it will be given to him: that is, that they 
become conformed to the glory of his own body, which is blessed 
forever and ever, Amen.70
Before their own resurrection believers may be “with Christ” in heaven, 
but they await the transformation of their own bodies to become glori-
ﬁ ed.71 While that will happen in the future, the condition that makes

ﬂ esh that Christ assumed.72",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=78

ﬁ nal transformation ﬁ nds expression toward the end of the tractates, 
where Hilary draws the distinction between Jerusalem and Zion. On 
Psalm 147:1 (“Praise the Lord, Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion”) Hilary argues that, while Jerusalem does not differ from Zion, the for-
mer is the actual city of peace, the congregation of the saints conformed 
to the glory of God. Zion, on the other hand, refers to those who look 
forward in expectation of that eschatological reality.73 “Sion means 
‘watching for [speculatio]’. Thus, in this body of the Lord, in which he 
rose from the dead, in which he sits at the right hand of power, in which 
is the glory of God the Father, we watch for our hope and our life.”74 The ﬁ rst verse of Psalm 14 represents a crucial text indicating Hilary’s 
understanding of the church as the body of Christ on earth: “Lord, who 
will inhabit your tabernacle, or who will rest on your holy mountain?” Hilary notes that this body is nothing besides the body the Word takes 
from us, but it is also the church: ecclesia corpus est Christi.75 Zion is the 
church, either the one that exists now or the company of saints to come, 
“which is full of the throng of those gloriﬁ ed through the resurrection 
and the joyful angels.”76 As we can see, although Hilary does not draw 
a vast distinction between the earthly church and the heavenly church, 
the ecclesia sanctorum is that which will be frequented through the res-
urrection of those who are congloriﬁ ed with Christ.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=79

is the glory of God the Father, we watch for our hope and our life.”74 The ﬁ rst verse of Psalm 14 represents a crucial text indicating Hilary’s

a vast distinction between the earthly church and the heavenly church, 
the ecclesia sanctorum is that which will be frequented through the res-
urrection of those who are congloriﬁ ed with Christ. Wild highlights 
the “eschatological turn of mind” in Hilary’s ecclesiology: “he sees 
every thing about man’s elevation as one, as consummated in heaven, 
and hence he glosses over the earthly aspects of our divinization.” 77
If Hilary’s understanding of divinization takes an “eschatological 
turn,” however, his exegesis presumes that Scripture’s very purpose is to 
reform the image and likeness of God in which a person has been cre-
ated, so as to attain that ﬁ nal consummation. Toward the beginning of 
his long commentary on Psalm 118, Hilary says that the psalmist forms 
us to be pleasing to God by giving us an education. 78 In explaining 
Psalm 118:73 (“Your hands have made me and prepared me: give me 
understanding and I will learn your mandates”) Hilary notes that the 
prophet understands the special honor of his original condition and
Expectatio Beatitudinis 65
wants to express this dignity with these words. 79 He goes on to explain 
the following verses, “Your word will remain into eternity, O Lord,” by 
asserting that the prophet, “while initiating us into the observance of a 
pure life, lifts up the humility of our nature to the understanding of di-
vine and invisible sacraments.”80 Although the Word abides forever in 
eternity, it is with us, says Hilary, when we are sober and in peace and 
temperate and merciful: when we are so disposed, the Word of God 
abides in us, and the old man is replaced by the new. It is those “who 
having died and been buried with Christ, have risen into the newness 
of life and are placed with him in heaven.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=80

mains, as if in heaven.”81 To meditate on verses such as Psalm 118:96 (“I 
have seen the end of every consummation”) is to ﬁ nd oneself within the 
narrative sweep that the psalmist sees with great clarity: “For he sees, 
the consummation of the resurrection . . . he recognizes the day of the 
kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we will be carried into 
the kingdom of God the Father and be transferred into those inscru-
table and unsearchable judgements of God.”82
Conclusion In his handbook of patristic eschatology, Brian Daley has argued that 
Christian faith “in the resolution of the unresolved” takes a wide range 
of articulations, depending on the context and particular mind of a be-
liever. 83 Not only does a thinker’s eschatology express, in future terms, 
the underlying assumptions of his or her thought, but it represents the 
logical conclusion of a doctrine of creation and Christology. 84 If Christ 
is conceived not simply as the incarnate Word but as the revelation of

clear in light of ﬁ nal things. Even the Psalms, which patristic exegetes 
had seen as fulﬁ lled in the life of Christ, ﬁ t within a broader Christian 
narrative, which looks forward in expectation of ﬁ nal beatitude. In an 
essay in which Brian Daley argues for the continued utility of patristic 
exegesis, he notes that the early church saw the Bible as a uniﬁ ed work 
suggesting a large narrative, whose mysteries always remain to be dis-
cerned. 86 Like the beatus uir of Psalm 1, the good exegete of the Psalms, 
in Hilary’s mind, is the one who remains humble, reverent, and studi-
ous before such mysteries while day and night he hopes, in Christ, to be 
transformed ﬁ nally into the perfect image of God. Those who have 
known, worked with, lived with Brian Daley are grateful for such a 
beatus uir in our own times. Notes 1. Karen Jo Torjesen, “Origen’s Interpretation of the Psalms,” in Studia

Suffering without Pain
The Scandal of Hilary of Poitiers’ Christology
Carl L. Beckwith
I
n the ﬁ nal books of De Trinitate, Hilary of Poitiers argues that Christ
 suffered on the cross without experiencing pain. This argument has 
endured more criticism throughout the history of the church than any 
other aspect of Hilary’s theology. Within a hundred years of Hilary’s 
death, Claudianus Mamertus accused him of undermining the truth 
of Christ’s passion and threatening our redemption.1 In the thirteenth 
century, Bonaventure was so troubled by Hilary’s comments on Christ’s 
suffering that he suggested they might be contra ﬁ dem.2 Bonaventure, 
sharing Mamertus’s concerns, argued that if anyone asserts that Christ 
suffered without pain, that person “not only evacuates the faith of 
Christ and the gospel of Christ but also evacuates our redemption and 
says that Christ is not the Christ.”3 Similar attempts to reconcile Hi-
lary’s infelicitous statements with the church’s teaching were made by 
Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas. Frustrated with efforts to re-
cover an orthodox understanding of Hilary’s Christology, someone, 
perhaps Bonaventure himself, relieved the situation by circulating a
72 Carl L. Beckwith
pious rumor. According to the rumor, William of Paris had seen a state-
ment of retraction in which Hilary corrected his unorthodox state-
ments on Christ’s suffering.4 This rumor freed the medieval writers 
from defending Hilary’s seemingly untenable christological position 
and preserved his orthodoxy and theological integrity for the medieval 
church. The usefulness of this rumor persisted well into the sixteenth 
century and is found, among other places, in the writings of the Lu-
theran theologian Martin Chemnitz.5 During the twentieth century, the pious rumor was put aside and 
the orthodoxy of Hilary’s Christology once again endured suspicion 
and scrutiny.6 Two distinct approaches emerged. E. W. Watson, the 
NPNF translator of Hilary’s De Trinitate, took a cautious approach. He 
writes, “Hilary has been accused of ‘sailing somewhat close to the cliffs 
of Docetism,’ but all admit that he has escaped shipwreck.”7 Watson’s 
cautious approach was also taken up by C. F. A. Borchardt, who con-
cluded that Hilary is “not a docetist in the strict sense of the word.”8",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=88

of Docetism,’ but all admit that he has escaped shipwreck.”7 Watson’s 
cautious approach was also taken up by C. F. A. Borchardt, who con-
cluded that Hilary is “not a docetist in the strict sense of the word.”8 In-
deed, he could not be a Docetist, notes Pierre Smulders, because he 
“emphasized that Christ had a true body and even that Christ died.”9 Paul Burns, working on Hilary’s earlier In Mattheum, writes, “By locat-
ing the sufferings of Christ within a human psychology, I suggest that 
Hilary cannot be accused of maintaining a purely docetic Christ. ”10 Fi-
nally, Mark Weedman, who places Hilary’s comments in De Trinitate in 
their wider fourth-century trinitarian context, characterizes the charge 
of Docetism as “artiﬁ cial.”11 
Rather than wrestling with the seemingly contradictory christo-
logical statements present in Hilary’s writings and concluding, as the 
scholars above have done, that he ultimately avoids error, R. P. C. 
Hanson has taken a dismissive approach, contending that Hilary was 
“nakedly Docetic” but in a “sophisticated way. ”12 Reminiscent of Clau-
dianus Mamertus and Bonaventure, Hanson argues that Hilary’s Chris-
tology is so unorthodox that it brings our redemption under question 
and makes us wonder if Christ was truly our Mediator.13 He writes,
This [i.e., Hilary’s Docetism] was partly because he went into 
greater detail in his Christology, partly because in spite of his dis-
avowal of philosophical inﬂ uences his mind was deeply dyed with
Suffering without Pain 73
the axiom that God is impassible (and that Jesus Christ was fully 
God), but partly too because he made the disastrous mistake of al-
lowing the story of the Virgin Birth, which plays so insigniﬁ cant a 
part in the New Testament, to control the whole of his Christology. In effect he concluded that at the very point where Christ’s soli-
darity with humankind is most crucial, in his suffering, Christ was 
not really human. Not only does this bring our redemption under 
question and do away explicitly with that central conviction of St. 
Paul, the scandal of the cross, but it leaves us uncertain as to whether 
such a ﬁ gure can seriously act as our Mediator. 14
Hanson’s assertions raise a number of questions. How do we account 
for Hilary’s continued emphasis on soteriology throughout De Trinitate 
and his repeated appeals to the saving work of Christ?",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=89

for Hilary’s continued emphasis on soteriology throughout De Trinitate 
and his repeated appeals to the saving work of Christ? How could Hil-
ary advance a nakedly docetic Christology, as Hanson argues, and yet 
assert that God suffered and died for our salvation—a point observed 
by the scholars taking the cautious approach? Hilary’s repeated empha-
sis on our salvation and the need to confess that Christ is true God and 
true man, who assumed our sin, suffered on the cross, and rose again 
from the dead for our salvation, seems inconsistent with the conclu-
sions drawn by Hanson. 15 In the following essay, I will determine in what sense Hilary sailed 
close to the cliffs of Docetism and whether he shipwrecked, as Claudi-
anus Mamertus, Bonaventure, and Hanson suggest, or avoided disaster, 
as Watson, Burns, and Weedman argue. I do this by reading Hilary’s 
comments on the suffering of Christ as he wished his readers to do, 
namely, against the background of his lengthy discussion of the two na-
tures in Christ, the character of Christ’s human soul, and the various 
divisive Christologies promoted by his opponents. The Purpose of the Incarnation
Hilary begins book 9 of De Trinitate by reminding the reader of the 
 exegetical tendencies of his opponents and how a proper interpretation 
of Scripture is to be achieved. 16 He accuses his opponents, as many of
74 Carl L. Beckwith
the church fathers before him had done, of taking words spoken in one 
context and for one purpose and rearranging them for use in a different 
context for a different purpose. 17 He then reminds the reader of “the 
universal faith” that must be confessed for eternal life. Hilary writes, He who does not know that Christ Jesus is true God and true man 
is thoroughly unacquainted with his own life—indeed knows 
nothing. It is equally dangerous to deny that Christ Jesus possesses 
the divine spiritus as it is to deny that he possesses the ﬂ esh of our 
bodies. 18 “Therefore everyone who shall confess me before men, I 
shall confess him before my Father who is in heaven. But whoever 
shall deny me before men, I shall deny him before my Father who 
is in heaven” (Matt 10:32–33).",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=90

is thoroughly unacquainted with his own life—indeed knows 
nothing. It is equally dangerous to deny that Christ Jesus possesses 
the divine spiritus as it is to deny that he possesses the ﬂ esh of our

shall confess him before my Father who is in heaven. But whoever 
shall deny me before men, I shall deny him before my Father who 
is in heaven” (Matt 10:32–33). The Word made ﬂ esh spoke these 
words and the man Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, taught them. He has been appointed mediator in his own person for the salva-
tion of the church, and the very mystery of being the mediator be-
tween God and man means that he is at the same time one and the 
other. From the natures united in him, he himself is the same per-
son [res] in both natures, in such a manner that he is wanting in nei-
ther, lest he cease to be God by his birth as man or fail to be man 
because he remains God. Accordingly, this is the true faith for 
human blessedness: to acknowledge him as God and man, to con-
fess him as Word and ﬂ esh, neither rejecting God because he is 
man, nor ignoring the ﬂ esh because he is the Word.19
Hilary’s commitment to a two-natures Christology is guided by Philip-
pians 2:6–7, “Christ Jesus who though he was in the form of God . . . 
took the form of a slave,” Colossians 2:8–9, “in him dwells all the full-
ness of the Godhead bodily,” and John 1:14, “the Word became ﬂ esh.” For Hilary, Jesus Christ is truly and completely God and truly and 
completely man, or, put simply, verum Deum et verum hominem. More-
over, despite the limitations of Hilary’s theological vocabulary, Christ, 
as man and God, is yet one acting subject. Since Christ is one acting 
subject in two natures, it is correct, proper, and necessary to attribute 
the properties of one nature to the other by virtue of their union (com-
municatio idiomatum). Therefore, on account of the incarnation, we
Suffering without Pain 75
rightly say that the Impassible suffers (inpassibilis patitur) and the Liv-
ing dies (vivens moritur).20 
For Hilary, these are not abstract musings about the two natures in 
Christ. Rather the confession that he is verum Deum et verum hominem 
is necessary to understand the mysteries of our salvation. 21 At the begin-
ning of book 9, Hilary explicitly states the reasons for the incarnation:",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=91

For Hilary, these are not abstract musings about the two natures in 
Christ. Rather the confession that he is verum Deum et verum hominem 
is necessary to understand the mysteries of our salvation. 21 At the begin-
ning of book 9, Hilary explicitly states the reasons for the incarnation: Now these are the mysteries of the heavenly plans determined be-
fore the foundation of the world: the only-begotten God chose to 
be born as man and man was to abide eternally in God . . . . And so 
God was born to assume us, then suffered to make us innocent, and 
ﬁ nally died to avenge us. For our humanity abides in God, the pas-
sions of our weaknesses are associated with God, and the spiritual 
forces of evil and malicious powers are subdued by the triumph of 
the ﬂ esh since God dies by means of the ﬂ esh [per carnem].22
Because there is only one acting subject in Christ who is both God and 
man, it is rightly said that God assumed our sin, suffered on the cross, 
and died. As Hilary puts it, “God dies by means of the ﬂ esh.” It is this 
truth, which is the scandal of the cross, that philosophy or worldly wis-
dom fails to grasp. Hilary continues with an extended discussion of the particulars of 
Christ’s saving work. Jesus Christ, in whom the fullness of the God-
head dwells bodily, took ﬂ esh that we might receive of his fullness by 
being reborn through faith unto eternal life. Elsewhere in the treatise 
Hilary puts it this way: “The Son of God is cruciﬁ ed, but on the cross 
God conquers human death. Christ, the Son of God, dies, but all ﬂ esh 
is made alive in Christ. The Son of God is in hell and man is brought 
back to heaven.”23 Our adoption into Christ and our salvation in him is 
made possible because God became man, assuming our lowliness, our 
weakness, and our sin so that we might assume his eternity, in part now 
by faith, in full in the world to come. Hilary summarizes Christ’s sav-
ing work by paraphrasing Colossians 2. He writes, “he brought us to 
life with himself, forgiving our sins and canceling the handwriting of 
the law of sin, which, because of the former ordinances, was opposed to 
us, abolishing it and nailing it to the cross, stripping himself of the ﬂ esh

over them in himself.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=92
93,"Christ, the Son of God, dies, but all ﬂ esh

76 Carl L. Beckwith
by the law of death, exposing the powers to mockery, and triumphing

he had to be verum Deum et verum hominem, as stressed above. Hilary 
emphatically writes, “Hold fast, therefore, to Christ the man, whom 
God has raised from the dead! Hold fast to Christ the God, accom-
plishing our salvation when he shall die!”25 
Hilary insists that we must understand and confess that the God 
who raised Christ from the dead is the same God who worked as Christ 
in the ﬂ esh and the one whom we say also died for us. Although our 
language constrains us to speak in such a way that we confess that 
Christ died in the ﬂ esh as man and that Christ was raised by God from 
the dead, such that we ascribe death to the man and the resurrection to 
the power of God, we must not forget that Christ, true God and man, 
is one (person), not two. These two natures, insists Hilary, do not imply 
two acting subjects that are somehow distinct from each other and 
work independently of one another. As such, we must never divide 
Christ, who is one, when discussing the actions proper to one nature. Hilary writes, Do you understand that the ﬂ esh that has been put off and he who 
puts off the ﬂ esh are not distinct from one another? He triumphs 
in his own person [in semetipso]—that is to say in that ﬂ esh which 
he himself put off. Do you realize that it is in this manner that he is 
proclaimed as God and man, such that the death is attributed to the 
man, and the resurrection of the ﬂ esh to God, but not in such a 
manner that he who died is one and he through whom the dead 
one is raised is another?",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=93

manner that he who died is one and he through whom the dead 
one is raised is another? The ﬂ esh put off is the dead Christ and 
again he who raises Christ from the dead is the same Christ who 
himself puts off the ﬂ esh. See the nature of God in the power of the 
resurrection and recognize the dispensation of man in the death. Although each action is done in accordance with its proper nature, 
bear in mind that it is one Christ Jesus [unum Christum Iesum] who 
is present in each of them. 26
Because Christ is one person, the actions formally attributed to one na-
ture are rightly communicated to the other by virtue of their union in 
this one person. As such, God suffers and dies for us just as the man
Suffering without Pain 77
Jesus raises the dead and forgives sins. A further point being made by 
Hilary is that no difference exists between saying that the Father raised 
Christ from the dead and Christ proclaiming, “I lay down my life that 
I may take it up again” (John 10:17–18). Just as we confess that there is 
one God in three persons, not three gods, so too we acknowledge that 
there is one power and one wisdom, not three powers or three wis-
doms.27 Hilary explains, “It is not to be understood as a contradiction 
when the Apostle proclaims Christ the power of God and the wisdom 
of God, and attributes all the magniﬁ cence of his work to the glory of 
the Father, since whatever Christ does, the power and wisdom of God 
does, and whatever the power and wisdom of God does, without any 
doubt God does, whose wisdom and power Christ is.” Christ possesses 
this power and wisdom not by adoption but because he possesses “a na-
ture that does not differ from that of God the Father.”28
Christ’s saving work was accomplished because he was true God 
and true man in one person. He possessed the weakness of man in his 
true and complete human nature and he possessed the power of God in 
his true and complete divine nature.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=94

Christ’s saving work was accomplished because he was true God 
and true man in one person. He possessed the weakness of man in his 
true and complete human nature and he possessed the power of God in 
his true and complete divine nature. As the Apostle writes, “For though 
he was cruciﬁ ed through weakness, yet he lives through the power 
of God” (2 Cor 13:4). Again the Apostle writes, “For the death that he 
died, he died to sin once for all, but the life that he lives, he lives unto 
God. Thus do you consider yourselves also as dead to sin, but alive to 
God in Christ Jesus” (Rom 6:10–11). Hilary comments, “He attributed 
death to sin, that is, to our body, but life to God whose nature it is that 
he lives. We ought, therefore, to die to our body that we may live to 
God in Christ Jesus, who, assuming our body of sin, lives now wholly 
for God, uniting the nature he shared with us into a participation of the 
divine immortality.”29 Through our adoption into Christ, we too will 
live wholly for God, realizing the true and complete humanity he pos-
sesses which is in perfect union with God—a union we were always in-
tended to share. The Suffering of Christ
By attending to Hilary’s discussion of the incarnation and the two na-
tures in Christ in book 9, we are able to navigate more successfully his

78 Carl L. Beckwith
discussion of Christ’s suffering without pain. When we turn to book 10 
of De Trinitate, we encounter the discussion that has troubled so many 
later commentators and invited the conclusion that Hilary’s statements 
appear to be contra ﬁ dem or nakedly docetic. Hilary characteristically begins his discussion by outlining the 
faulty theological method of his opponents. Their distorted view of 
Christ results from their refusal to submit to the words of Scripture.30 They prefer, instead, to follow their own perverted will, a will that re-
jects the truth of Scripture by accepting whatever seems pleasing to it at 
the moment. As Hilary puts it, these opponents defend as true what-
ever they desire rather than desiring what is true.31 By neglecting the 
truth of Scripture and proclaiming as true only what agrees with their 
limited understanding, these opponents proclaim a “fatal doctrine,” ei-
ther asserting that Jesus is “not God” or “speaking of two gods differing 
in their divinity. ”32
At this point, Hilary summarizes what he has argued throughout 
De Trinitate. The Son is not a God of a nature different from God the 
Father, nor are Father and Son merely names designating the same 
being at different times. The Father and Son are eternally distinct from 
one another yet indistinguishable in power and substance such that 
they are not two gods. The Son is eternally and ineffably generated 
from the Father in a manner that transcends all human understanding. Finally, in these latter days, the Son, by the power of the Holy Spirit, 
was born from the Virgin Mary, emptying himself of the form of God 
and receiving the form of a slave.33 Here, we arrive at the issue that will 
occupy Hilary for the rest of book 10: if Jesus, as true man and true 
God, possesses the nature of an impassible God, how do you account for 
his suffering? 34",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=96

God, possesses the nature of an impassible God, how do you account for 
his suffering? 34 As we will see, Hilary’s opponents promote a false un-
derstanding of Christ in order to avoid the seemingly contradictory 
conclusion that the impassible God suffered and died. The question of God’s suffering and the presence of pain in that 
suffering is for Hilary a question about the type of body and soul pos-
sessed by Christ. He writes, “Let us see what kind of body the man 
Christ possessed, so that the pain should remain in the suspended, 
bound, and pierced ﬂ esh.”35 We see immediately that for Hilary the 
issue is not, strictly speaking, whether Christ, the incarnate Son of God,
Suffering without Pain 79
suffered, but whether he experienced pain in that suffering. 36 There is 
no question that God suffered and died by means of the ﬂ esh he as-
sumed. As described above, Hilary does not hesitate to assert that the 
Impassible suffered (inpassibilis patitur) and the Living died (vivens 
moritur). To argue that Christ did not truly suffer and die would sug-
gest that his humanity was not real and would lead to the error of the 
Docetists. Hilary is aware that such a view argues that Christ had only 
a “phantom” ( fantasma) body, and he emphatically denounces it.37 Although suffering is not an issue for Hilary, the question of pain 
is another matter. Hilary ﬁ rmly rejects the notion that Christ felt pain 
when he suffered. For Hilary pain is felt by the soul, not the ﬂ esh. It is 
the nature of bodies, argues Hilary, that by their association with the 
soul they are animated. As such, “when punctured or torn bodies suffer 
pain, the feeling of the pain is received through the sensation of the soul 
that has been poured into them. ”38 If the union with the soul is severed, 
the body experiences no pain. The question is naturally asked, “Did 
Christ experience pain?” If he did, he must not be God because pain in-
volves change or corruption and God is incorruptible and impassible.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=97
98,"As such, “when punctured or torn bodies suffer

the body experiences no pain. The question is naturally asked, “Did 
Christ experience pain?” If he did, he must not be God because pain in-
volves change or corruption and God is incorruptible and impassible. On the other hand, if he did not experience pain, then, it seems to fol-
low that he did not possess a human soul and his humanity is incom-
plete. Hilary writes, If it were true that the man Jesus Christ began his life as our body 
and soul begin, and if he were not God, the ruling principle [prin-
ceps] of his own body and soul, when he was fashioned in the like-
ness of man and found in the form of man and born, then, yes, he 
would have felt the pain of our body since he would have been con-
ceived as we are and possessed a body animated at conception by a 
soul like our own.39
Hilary rejects both alternatives and clearly asserts that Christ is God 
and possesses a human soul. He also introduces a distinction between a 
“weak soul” (animae inﬁ rmis) and, presumably, a strong or true or com-
plete soul.40 A person feels the pain inﬂ icted on the body because he pos-
sesses a soul weakened by sin. To assert that Jesus felt pain would be to 
attribute a “weak soul” to him. The only way Christ could have a weak
80 Carl L. Beckwith
soul, which is a soul belonging to a person conceived and born “natu-
rally,” that is, a soul born with sin,41 is if the man Jesus existed before the 
Word assumed him. If he did, then he had a body and soul prior to his 
union with the Word. This argument would lead Hilary to two conclu-
sions that he is unwilling to draw. First, that there was a time when the 
man Jesus existed before being assumed by the Word and, therefore, 
that there are two acting subjects in Jesus Christ, one human and one 
divine. To exist as man before being assumed by the Word means that 
the man became God rather than God becoming man. Although such 
a divisive Christology could easily account for suffering and pain, it 
would destroy the unity of Christ, undermine the incarnation, and ul-
timately evacuate any soteriological value to Christ’s redeeming work. Second, even if this were the case, Hilary is not willing to concede that 
the adopted man would have necessarily felt pain.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=98

the adopted man would have necessarily felt pain. That is to say, it is 
possible for someone born naturally with a weak soul to suffer in the 
body without feeling the pain of that suffering. As we will see, this is an 
important point for Hilary that will be crucial in his understanding of 
Christ’s body and soul. Hilary continues,
But if through his own effort he assumed ﬂ esh from the Virgin and 
if he himself also joined a soul to the body conceived through him-
self, then the nature of his suffering must be in keeping with the 
nature of his body and soul. For when he emptied himself of the 
form of God and received the form of a slave, and when the Son of 
God was born as the Son of Man, without sacriﬁ cing anything of 
himself and his own power, then God the Word brought about the 
perfect living man.42
For Hilary “every soul is the work of God” and created directly by God 
for each person. 43 As such, ﬂ esh begets ﬂ esh but the soul is from God. Therefore, at every human conception, God imparts a soul that ani-
mates the ﬂ esh and makes a human being. 44 In the case of Jesus, he was 
conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, and was the per-
fect living man. This “spiritual conception” (spiritalis conceptionis), as 
Hilary calls it, means that the human soul was ineffably united to the 
Word in such a way as to animate Jesus Christ, true God and true man.45
Suffering without Pain 81
Hilary explains, “just as in the nature appointed for us by God, the 
source of our origin, man is born with a body and soul, so too Jesus 
Christ, by his own power, is God and man with ﬂ esh [carnis] and soul 
[animae], possessing in himself both truly and completely what man is 
and truly and completely what God is.”46 In the case of all humans, our 
bodies are animated when God bestows a soul upon us at conception.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=99

bodies are animated when God bestows a soul upon us at conception. In 
the case of Jesus, the Word animates the ﬂ esh not by becoming its ani-
mating principle to the exclusion of a human soul but by uniting with 
that human soul in a mysterious and nontemporal manner. 47 At this point, Hilary articulates his position against the backdrop 
of one of the Christologies advanced by his opponents. By drawing this 
contrast, Hilary reveals to us what is at stake for him in this discussion 
and why he feels compelled to assert what he does about suffering and 
pain. He writes, “They do not wish the only-begotten God, who in the 
beginning was God the Word with God [apud Deum], to be a self- 
existent God [substantiuum Deum], but merely the utterance of a voice, 
so that what a word is to those who speak, so too this Son is to God 
the Father.”48 By paraphrasing the beginning of St. John’s prologue, 
emphasizing that the Word was apud Deum, and using the phrase “ut-
terance of a voice,” Hilary is characterizing these opponents as pro-
moting the christological position of Photinus of Sirmium.49 Hilary 
comments, They subtly wish to insinuate that it was not the Word of God sub-
sisting and remaining in the form of God who was born as Christ 
the man. Rather, since the cause of the man’s life was of human ori-
gin rather than the mystery of a spiritual conception [spiritalis con-
ceptionis], he was not God the Word who made himself man by 
birth from the Virgin, but as the spirit of prophecy was in the 
prophets, so the Word of God was in Jesus.50

comments, They subtly wish to insinuate that it was not the Word of God sub-
sisting and remaining in the form of God who was born as Christ 
the man. Rather, since the cause of the man’s life was of human ori-
gin rather than the mystery of a spiritual conception [spiritalis con-
ceptionis], he was not God the Word who made himself man by 
birth from the Virgin, but as the spirit of prophecy was in the 
prophets, so the Word of God was in Jesus.50
Their position asserts that Jesus existed as a true living man, animated 
by a human soul, prior in time to his union with the Word. Such a posi-
tion assumes that there are two acting subjects or subjects of predica-
tion in Jesus Christ, and, moreover, that he is God not by birth but by 
adoption. On the contrary, the proper way of understanding the  mystery
82 Carl L. Beckwith
of Christ’s spiritual conception, explains Hilary, is that “He was born 
not that he might be ﬁ rst one and then another, but that it might be un-
derstood that the one who was God before he was man is the same one 
who has now assumed a human nature and is both God and man.”51 
Hilary rejects the adoptionist position by arguing that the true union of 
the Word with humanity does not allow for two centers of conscious-
ness or acting subjects united together to form Jesus Christ, true God 
and true man, but rather allows only one. To suggest otherwise pro-
motes a divisive Christology that either compromises Christ’s divinity 
or humanity or asserts a tertium quid. As such, when we say that Christ 
was in the form of God and the form of a slave, we mean that while he 
is truly God and truly man he is also “one and the same” (unum tamen 
eumdemque). Hilary asserts,
Therefore, after Jesus Christ was born, suffered, died, and was 
buried, he also rose again.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=101

to be divided from himself such that he is not Christ—since 
there is no other Christ than the one who in the form of God re-
ceived the form of a slave, nor is the one who died different from 
the one who was born, nor is the one who rose again different 
from the one who died, nor is the one in heaven different from the 
one who rose again, nor ﬁ nally is the one in heaven different from 
the one who previously descended from heaven. 52
Hilary is quite clear that in Christ Jesus there is one acting subject in 
two natures. The assumed man is not another person from the person 
of the Word but is one and the same, unum eumdemque. Moreover, the 
Word is the ultimate subject of all predication, and therefore it is cor-
rect to say that God truly suffered and died on the cross, or the inpassi-
bilis patitur and the vivens moritur.53 At this point in book 10, Hilary takes up the question of how Christ 
is said to suffer without compromising his divinity. As seen above, Hil-
ary has all the resources necessary to locate that suffering in Christ’s 
 humanity and to attribute the full range of emotions associated with 
human suffering to Christ’s human soul. Moreover, by virtue of the 
union between divinity and humanity, as expounded by Hilary, he 
would be able to attribute this suffering and pain to God through

the communicatio idiomatum. But although he will continue to attribute 
suffering and death to God through the communicatio, he will not, be-
cause of his theological anthropology, which is guided by a Stoic moral 
psychology, attribute fear or pain to Christ’s soul. Hilary insists on a dis-
tinction between suffering and pain that ultimately rests upon his ear-
lier distinction between a soul weakened by sin and a strong or complete 
soul free from sin. Jesus Christ, the only-begotten God, who is the Son 
of Man and the Son of God, was struck, wounded, and experienced the 
violence of the passion, but such suffering “did not occasion the pain of 
the passion.”54 According to Hilary,
The Lord Jesus Christ truly suffers when he is struck, suspended, 
cruciﬁ ed, and dies. But the suffering that assails the body, although 
a true suffering, does not manifest the nature of suffering [naturam 
passionis]. Although the suffering rages with the purpose of deliv-
ering punishment, the power of the body [virtus corporis] receives 
the force of the pain against itself without feeling pain. 55 To this point, Hilary seems to be saying only that outside the communi-
catio idiomatum the divinity of Christ does not experience the pain or 
corruption of his suffering. According to the communicatio, God suf-
fered, but that should not be understood to mean that the substance or 
essence of God is corruptible and passible. 56 Hilary, however, intends to 
say more than this: It is true that the body of the Lord would have been capable of feel-
ing pain as our natures do, if our body possessed such a nature as 
treads upon the waves and walks on the waters without sinking as 
it walks or forcing the waters apart by the pressure of its footsteps, 
or if it could pass through solid structures and not be hindered 
by the obstacle of a closed house.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=103

the Lord’s body, so that by his own power, his soul is borne over the 
water, treads upon the waves, and passes through walls, why do we 
judge the ﬂ esh conceived by the Spirit according to the nature of 
the human body [conceived naturally]? That ﬂ esh, that is, that 
Bread, is from heaven, and that man is from God. He certainly 
 possessed a body to suffer, and he did suffer, but he did not possess
84 Carl L. Beckwith
a nature that could be touched by pain. For that body possessed a 
nature unique and peculiar to itself; a body that was transﬁ gured in 
heavenly glory on the mountain, drove away fevers by its touch, 
and restored eyesight by its spittle. 57 We begin to see what is involved in possessing a strong or complete soul 
free from all sin. As is indicated in the scriptural narrative, Christ’s 
body was transﬁ gured or sanctiﬁ ed or divinized to such an extent that 
it could walk on water and drive away fevers by its touch. 58 Therefore, 
asserts Hilary, that body truly suffered but did not possess a “nature” 
that could feel pain. To borrow a phrase from Maximus Confessor, Hil-
ary seems to suggest that Christ truly suffered but did so divinely. 59 This divine suffering does not manifest the experience of pain because 
Christ possesses a perfect human nature, not a sinful human nature. The indebtedness of Hilary’s theological anthropology to a Stoic 
moral psychology has long been observed. 60 As indicated above, Hilary

does not embrace a bipartite or tripartite division of the soul, as many 
of his Platonic contemporaries did. Hilary’s commitment to a uniﬁ ed 
soul has important implications for his Christology. According to Stoic 
epistemology and ethics, the soul encounters impressions or desires in 
its engagement with the world, and these impressions impact or alter 
the soul depending on the state of the agent’s moral progress.61 To use 
Hilary’s terms, a “weak” soul responds to an impression with the action 
that appears necessary based on the content of the impression. A 
“strong” soul, on the other hand, considers the content of the impres-
sion and the reality it intends to represent before dismissing it as false 
or assenting to it as true. As such, the “weak” soul is moved by the im-
pression itself, and the “strong” soul is moved by its deliberation of the 
impression as true or false. 62 Since this assent is given by a uniﬁ ed soul, 
there is no conﬂ ict between rational and irrational parts such that the 
irrational could triumph over the rational by being misled by a false im-
pression. 63 Since the impression and the assent belong to the same fac-
ulty, the individual who properly exercises reason will always avoid 
error. Or, as Hilary would put it, the person with a strong soul will al-
ways avoid sin. Suffering without Pain 85 The assent of the soul to an impression is an expression of belief 
that is characterized as either an “opinion” that is false or true, or 
“knowledge” that is always true and is the characteristic of the Stoic 
sage. Moreover, for the Stoic, virtue alone is good and evil alone is bad. All other things are considered “indifferent” because they are neither 
beneﬁ cial nor harmful. 64 The problem with most people, however, is 
that they falsely assign value to things that are indifferent. As such, 
health, wealth, and comfort are judged as good, and disease, poverty, 
and pain are judged as evil. Life is ordered around the attainment of 
false goods and the avoidance of false evils. These false beliefs are char-
acterized as “emotions.”65 The four main species of emotion are desire, 
fear, pleasure, and pain. In terms of Hilary’s Christology, the emotions 
of fear and pain are particularly relevant. Fear is the opinion that some 
future thing is evil and should be avoided. Pain is the opinion that some 
present thing is evil and we should be sad about it.66 As such, regret and 
mourning are both a subspecies of pain.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=105

future thing is evil and should be avoided. Pain is the opinion that some 
present thing is evil and we should be sad about it.66 As such, regret and 
mourning are both a subspecies of pain. Here we see that the real issue 
for the Stoic is the emotional value attached to pain. Since pain is nei-
ther a virtue nor a vice, no such emotional value should be given it by 
the soul. When this happens, the soul is involved in the suffering and 
pain of the body because it has succumbed to a false impression and 
false belief. Since assigning the value of good or evil to an indifferent 
thing is false, the Stoic sage will never have these emotions. 67
Hilary’s Christology is guided by this Stoic anthropology and moral 
psychology. 68 Christ’s human soul, by virtue of its spiritual conception, 
is endowed from birth with a strong soul, which is to say a soul without 
sin, and therefore immune to the false beliefs expressed by the emotions 
of desire, fear, pleasure, and pain. 69 Since the union between the Word 
and the humanity happens according to the person, the man Jesus never 
existed with a body and soul prior to his spiritual conception. For Hil-
ary, such a conception, unique to Christ alone, does not mean that Jesus 
is without a human soul but rather that the human soul is so infused 
with the power of the Word that it is sanctiﬁ ed or divinized to the point 
that it experiences no corruption or pain. Put another way, the hu-
manity of Christ is appropriated by the Word in such a way that it is 
entirely without sin and is therefore the most true and complete ex-
ample of humanity ever known. Understood in this way, Christ’s
86 Carl L. Beckwith
 humanity underscores a fundamental soteriological point for Hilary. The union between the divinity and humanity in Christ expresses the 
intimacy with God that is the goal and principle by which all humans 
seek union with God. As Hilary explains, It was not necessary for him, through whom man was made, to be-
come man, but it was necessary for us that God take ﬂ esh and dwell 
among us, that is, by the assumption of one ﬂ esh he made all ﬂ esh 
his home. His humility is our nobility, his shame our honor.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=106

his home. His humility is our nobility, his shame our honor. As 
such, God assumed ﬂ esh that we, in turn, would be restored from 
the ﬂ esh to God.70
Through such a union we become most truly human as we are freed 
from the disordering effects of our sin, effects which only diminish our 
true humaneness and humanity and lead us to regard indifferent things 
as true or false. Christ’s humanity, then, is not less human because he 
suffers without pain; rather, according to Hilary’s anthropology and 
moral psychology, he is more truly human because his soul is properly 
and perfectly ordered toward that which is true and good. The Suffering of the Martyrs
For Hilary, the sanctiﬁ cation or divinization of Christ’s soul is the goal 
of all humanity and is partially seen in the suffering and courage of the 
martyrs. Hilary explains,
Since the consciousness of an animated body derives life from its 
association with the soul diffused throughout it, and the soul min-
gled with the body gives life to it in order to experience the pain in-
ﬂ icted upon it, whenever the soul in the blessed zeal of its heavenly 
faith and hope looks down upon the beginning of the body’s earthly 
origin, the body forms a unique consciousness and spirit for itself 
toward pain, so that it no longer feels the suffering that it suffers. 71 
Again, the soul is what allows the body to experience pain. Because of 
Christ’s spiritual conception, which for Hilary seems to be a way of
Suffering without Pain 87
 designating the hypostatic union, the human soul, which is ordinarily 
the center of consciousness or acting subject for a human being, min-
gles with the power of God in such a way that there is only one person 
in Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God. Such a special union means that 
although suffering and pain rage against the body of Christ on the cross 
and the person of Christ receives that suffering, he does so impassibly. Although this sounds contradictory, Hilary insists it is not. As he ex-
plains, “even earthly bodies are unaware of fear and pain where there 
should certainly be pain and fear.”72",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=107

and the person of Christ receives that suffering, he does so impassibly. Although this sounds contradictory, Hilary insists it is not. As he ex-
plains, “even earthly bodies are unaware of fear and pain where there 
should certainly be pain and fear.”72 We see this with Shadrach, Me-
shach, and Abednego in the ﬁ ery furnace, with Daniel in the lions’ den, 
and with the apostles who rejoice to suffer in the name of Christ. In 
each case, these individuals overcome the natural fear and pain experi-
enced by their bodies through the blessed zeal of their faith and hope. By anticipating their complete and perfect union with God in glory and 
their crown of righteousness, the fear and pain of the martyrs is over-
come by an emboldened and joyous soul: With hymns the martyrs offer their necks to the executioners to be 
cut off and with canticles they ascend the pile of burning logs raised 
for them. As they are doing this, the consciousness of their faith re-
moves from their bodies the fear of a natural weakness and changes 
those very bodies in such a manner that they are no longer aware of 
the pain they feel. As such, the resolve [ﬁ rmitas] of their bodies is 
strengthened by the purpose of the soul, and the animated body en-
dures only that toward which it is moved by the zeal of its soul. Therefore the body, emboldened by the soul, does not feel the suf-
fering that the soul disregards because of its desire for glory. 73
For Hilary, Christ possesses a humanity truer and more consonant 
with God’s creative intentions. His humanity is unlike ours in that it is 
free from all sin and therefore a truer example of humanity than our 
humanity, which is disordered and fragmented by sin. The union with 
the Word infuses the humanity with such power that it is perfectly 
sanctiﬁ ed or divinized. It is this perfection that the martyrs anticipate 
with the consciousness of their faith, a faith that emboldens their soul 
and strengthens their bodies to endure the suffering of their martyr-
doms without fear of death and the pain of suffering. 74 Put another

ferent value. The martyr’s fear is overcome with joy as the soul now 
sees death as another name for eternal life.75 The pain inﬂ icted on the 
martyr’s body does not touch the soul because the soul is united to the 
Truth and confesses with the apostle, “It is no longer I who live but 
Christ who lives in me” (Gal 2:20). If the martyrs, who were conceived 
with a sinful nature, do not fear their impending death or experience 
the pain of their suffering because of the zeal and anticipation of their 
faith, then surely, argues Hilary, Christ, who is born without sin and 
who bestows the gift of salvation through his cross and suffering, nei-
ther fears the cross nor succumbs to the pain of his suffering. Hilary 
concludes,
Therefore, the only-begotten God suffered all the inﬁ rmities of our 
passions that pressed upon him but he suffered according to the 
power of his nature . . . . It follows that he suffered the inﬁ rmities 
of our bodies in his own body, but took upon himself the passions 
of our body according to the power of his own body. And to this 
part of our faith the word of the prophet testiﬁ es when he says, “He 
bears our sins and suffers for us. And we looked upon him in his 
sorrows, in his blows, and in his hardship. But he was wounded for 
our iniquities and he was made weak because of our sins” (Isa 
53:4–5). Therefore the opinion of human judgment is false when it 
supposes that he felt pain because he suffered. To be sure, he “bore 
our sins,” that is to say, he assumed our body of sin, but he was him-
self without sin. For indeed, he was sent “in the likeness of sinful 
ﬂ esh” (Rom 8:3), truly bearing sin in the ﬂ esh, but those sins were 
ours.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=109

53:4–5). Therefore the opinion of human judgment is false when it

self without sin. For indeed, he was sent “in the likeness of sinful 
ﬂ esh” (Rom 8:3), truly bearing sin in the ﬂ esh, but those sins were 
ours. And he suffered pain for us, but he did not suffer pain as we 
experience it because “he was found in the appearance of man” 
(Phil 2:7), possessing for himself a body subject to pain, but not pos-
sessing a nature subject to pain. Although “found in the appear-
ance of man,” his origin was not that of a natural birth but rather 
he was born by a conception of the Holy Spirit.76
Just as it is correct to say, according to Scripture, that Christ bears our 
sins, we also acknowledge that he himself does not commit sin. So too,
Suffering without Pain 89
argues Hilary, according to Scripture, Christ truly suffered and pos-
sessed a true body subject to pain, but, because he is God and because a 
true union exists between the Word and the man such that there is one 
person in two natures, Christ did not succumb to the pain of that suf-
fering. Hilary’s Conclusion
After his lengthy discussion of Christ’s two natures and the manner in 
which Christ suffered without pain, Hilary ends book 10 of De Trini-
tate by exposing the weaknesses of the various Christologies advanced 
by his opponents. Here we encounter the historical challenge faced by 
Hilary in articulating his Christology. If he were to assert that Christ 
suffered with pain, he would, in his estimation, be forced to embrace 
one of the divisive Christologies articulated by his opponents. Hilary identiﬁ es two false Christologies that undermine the faith 
of the church and our salvation in Christ. The ﬁ rst group argues that 
God the Word was “completely absorbed into the soul of the body” and 
“performed the duty of the soul in vivifying the body.”77 Although this 
christological position becomes explicit in the writings of Apollinarius 
of Laodicea, it is most likely known to Hilary from “Arian” circles. Hilary’s criticism of this Christology is that it ultimately undermines 
Jesus’ identity as true God and true man.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=110

Jesus’ identity as true God and true man. The second group of oppo-
nents rejected by Hilary argues that the Word of God “dwelt in him 
[i.e., the man Jesus] as the Spirit had dwelt in the Prophets.”78 This 
adoptionist Christology, which we encountered above, is associated 
with Photinus of Sirmium, who argues that “Jesus Christ is not Christ 
before he was born from Mary.”79 Rather, the Word “extends” itself and 
dwells in the man Jesus, who, according to Photinus, does possess a 
human soul. The faith of the church, argues Hilary, “does not separate Jesus 
Christ so that Jesus himself is not Christ. Moreover, it neither distin-
guishes the Son of Man from the Son of God, lest, perhaps, the Son of 
God is not also rightly judged as the Son of Man, nor does it absorb the 
Son of God into the Son of Man.” As argued above, these divisive Chris-
tologies, in seeking to protect the impassibility and immutability of
90 Carl L. Beckwith
God, diminish either Christ’s divinity or humanity and inevitably lead 
to a tertium quid. Hilary rejects such Christologies as heresies:
[The faith of the church] neither separates Christ by a threefold 
faith . . . so that Jesus Christ is cut up into Word, soul, and body, nor 
again does it absorb God the Word into the soul and body. In him 
is the whole God the Word and in him is the whole man Christ. We cleave to this one thing in the mystery of our confession: never 
to believe that Christ is anything other than Jesus, nor to preach 
that Jesus is anything other than Christ.80
Jesus Christ is truly man and truly God in one person. To suggest oth-
erwise is to deny the salvation won for us by Christ. The divisive Chris-
tologies of the heretics sever, divide, and separate Christ. They believe 
that Christ cruciﬁ ed is one person and the wisdom of God another per-
son. They believe that the Son of Man is one person and the Son of God 
another person. 81 A proper and orthodox Christology does not divide 
Christ but regards the one who reigns in heaven as the same one who 
dies on the cross for our salvation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=111

Hilary ends his discussion in De Trinitate as he began it, with com-
ments on theological method and the faith of the church. We must bear 
in mind, he urges, the limitations of our minds to grasp and our words 
to express the mystery of Christ’s incarnation and passion. Moreover, 
we must recognize that a discussion of the two natures in Christ and 
their union and the manner in which Christ suffered and died on the 
cross, although necessitating abstract language, deals with the central 
teaching of the church, our salvation in Christ Jesus. Hilary’s pastoral 
concern emerges at this very point. Salvation consists not in subtle dis-
tinctions or persuasive speech but in confessing that Jesus is Lord and 
knowing that he died in order that we might live in him. Hilary ex-
plains, 
What madness it is to represent falsely the nature and character of 
Jesus Christ, when salvation consists only in knowing that he alone 
is Lord! . . . God does not call us to the blessed life through difﬁ cult 
questions, nor does he create confusion for us by the various uses of
Suffering without Pain 91
persuasive speech. For us eternal life is certain and easy:  believe 
that Jesus was raised from the dead by God and confess that he 
himself is the Lord. Therefore, let no one falsely use what we have 
discussed in our ignorance as an opportunity for impiety. We must 
know that Jesus Christ died for us that we might live in him. 83
Had Hilary not entertained a discussion on the nature of Christ’s 
suffering or the relationship between experiencing pain and feeling 
pain, his Christology would never have raised suspicions in the ﬁ fth 
century, the thirteenth century, or today. At the same time, when we 
read Hilary’s comments on Christ’s suffering in the context of his dis-
cussion of the incarnation and human soul in Christ and when we ob-
serve his indebtedness to a Stoic moral psychology, it is apparent that he 
is neither “nakedly Docetic” nor does he sail close to the cliffs of Do-
cetism.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=112

cabulary and never fully exploits his insights on Christ’s human soul to 
account for the range of emotions experienced by Christ on the cross, 
his consistent articulation of two natures in one acting subject, his com-
mitment to the presence of a human soul in Christ, and, ﬁ nally, his in-
sistence that God truly suffered and died in the ﬂ esh for our salvation 
marks his Christology as an important contribution to fourth-century 
patristic thought and a decisive step toward the theological formula-
tions embraced a hundred years later at Chalcedon. Notes My interest and fascination with Hilary of Poitiers was ﬁ rst kindled at Notre 
Dame in Brian Daley’s doctoral seminar on fourth-century trinitarian theology. I will always be indebted to Brian for his gentle mentoring, his friendship, and 
for showing me how to handle with care and sensitivity the theological, histori-
cal, and pastoral issues involved in the writings of the church fathers. It is a plea-
sure to offer this essay on Hilary’s Christology in honor of my friend and 
mentor. 1. Claudianus Mamertus, De Statu Animae (PL 53.752B). 2. Bonaventure, Commentaria in Quatuor Libros Sententiarum, in S. Bona-

ture by appealing to the context, place, or logic of a particular text within the 
larger narrative of salvation history or God’s progressive revelation to us about 
the Son. By reading Scripture within such a context, they were enabled to inter-

(De Anima 19), but in the fourth century Lactantius had insisted on the soul’s 
origin as deriving from God’s direct creation (De Opiﬁ cio Deo 19). Augustine is 
famously divided on the question (De libero arbitrio 3.20.56–57; Retractiones 
[Contra Academicos] 1.1.3; and De anima et eius origine). 45. For the phrase, spiritalis conceptionis, cf. De Trin. X.21.7 and X.35.15. 46. De Trin. X.19.5–10 47. For Hilary’s explicit rejection that the Word replaces the human soul in 
Christ, cf. De Trin. X.50–52. 48. De Trin. X.21.1–4. 49. Cf. De Trin. II.4.5–10: “Thus, Ebion [Photinus], assuming a beginning 
entirely from Mary, produces not a man from God, but God from man. The 
Virgin would not have received the pre-existing Word that was in the beginning 
with God and was God, but would have brought forth ﬂ esh through the Word. He [Photinus] says that the nature of the only-begotten God did not exist before 
in the Word, but was [only] a sound uttered by a voice.” Hilary uses the begin-
ning of the prologue to St. John’s Gospel in his Commentarium in Matthaeum, De 
Fide, and De Synodis to refute the teachings he associates with Photinus of Sir-
mium. For a further discussion of Hilary and Photinus and the distinction 
 between apud Deum and in Deo, see Carl L. Beckwith, “Photinian Opponents

different experiences to the appropriate nature, and emphatically states that “the 
same one” who reigns in heaven dies on the cross and the one who dies is the 
same as the one who reigns. 53. It should be noted that despite the true union of the Word and the ﬂ esh, 
the Word still remains the Lord of heaven and earth and is present everywhere. Cf. De Trin. X.16. 54. De Trin. X.23. 55. De Trin. X.23.14–19. 56. De Trin.

is found, of course, in Cyril of Alexandria. Cf. Warren J. Smith, “Suffering Im-

(2002): 463–83. 60. Although not the ﬁ rst study to identify Stoic elements in Hilary’s Chris-
tology, the most signiﬁ cant is Favre, “La communication,” 481–514. For more 
recent works, cf. Doignon, Hilaire de Poitiers avant l’exil, 375; Burns, Christology,

Polycarp’s impending death is replaced by joy (cara'~), and in the Martyrdom of 
Perpetua and Felicitas (18.1), Perpetua trembled with joy (gaudio), not fear

Gregory of Nazianzus on

ne of the many fruits of Brian Daley’s career as a patristic scholar 
has been his demonstration that Cappadocian Christology is much 
richer than the received categories of interpretation have admitted. In 
two recent articles and in his 2002 D’Arcy Lectures in Oxford, Daley 
has shown that Gregory of Nyssa offers a consistent and powerful 
“Christology of transformation.”1 Despite his reputation for being puz-
zling and unsatisfactory according to the canons of ﬁ fth-century con-
troversy, Gregory of Nyssa represents Christ as being so thoroughly 
divinized in his humanity—to the point that he is no longer even 
human, in the “ﬂ eshly” sense, after the resurrection2—that all human

98 Christopher A. Beeley
beings can ﬁ nd their own transformation in his. For similar reasons, 
the Christology of Gregory of Nazianzus—on whom Daley has also 
authored several studies3—is in need of reassessment as well. Scholars 
have long recognized that Gregory’s Letters to Cledonius (Ep. 101–2) 
and to Nectarius (Ep. 202) are major christological treatises that signiﬁ -
cantly inﬂ uenced later developments; his famous Theological Orations 
(Or. 27–31) have long been regarded as classic expressions of Trini-
tarian orthodoxy.4 Yet, as with Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen’s 
doctrine of Christ remains encumbered by anachronistic views that 
largely overlook his own rather substantial interests. To mention just two points of confusion: Gregory of Nazianzus’s 
Christology—like that of many pre-scholastic writers—has suffered 
the fate of being artiﬁ cially separated from his doctrine of the Trinity, 
despite the fact that his work very strongly resists such a division. Even 
though Gregory’s doctrine of Christ takes shape primarily in Constan-
tinople from 379 to 381 in opposition to homoian and anhomoian posi-
tions, scholars have typically focused on his late Ep. 101–2 and 202, 
from A.D. 382 to 383, at the expense of his more substantial, earlier 
work. A second, related matter is that Gregory’s Christology tends to 
be characterized primarily as anti-Apollinarian. For many years the 
standard handbooks have depicted Cappadocian Christology as essen-
tially an orthodox response to the Apollinarian problem.5 Yet this is a 
rather odd judgment, if we consider that Gregory hardly mentions 
Apollinarius until the end of his career; and it is questionable whether 
even at this late date he thinks Apollinarius’s is the worst christological 
error on the contemporary scene, compared with the alternatives pre-
sented by Eunomius of Cyzicus and Diodore of Tarsus. The resulting 
neglect of Gregory’s central concerns is both unfortunate and ironic, 
considering his seminal place in later Christian tradition and the great 
esteem in which he was held by later theologians such as Cyril of Alex-
andria and Maximus Confessor. Central to the scholarly confusion is the question of whether Greg-
ory’s Christology is basically unitive or dualist. According to the re-
ceived interpretation, Gregory holds a primarily dualist understanding 
of Christ’s identity.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=120

that there are two sons.6 Alois Grillmeier focuses on Gregory’s two- 
nature language, and goes so far as to conclude that “[Gregory’s] own 
Chris tological formula . . . sounds very ‘Antiochene.’”7 One can ﬁ nd 
similar assessments in more recent scholarship as well.8 On this read-
ing, Gregory is a kind of proto-Chalcedonian—or even a represen-
tative  Antiochene—stressing the distinction between the divine and 
human natures of Christ against imagined proto-Eutychians, who 
wrongly confuse them or collapse them into one another. While there 
are certain passages that might lend themselves to a dualist reading—
several of which we will consider below—my contention is that the re-
ceived view has it rather backwards and overlooks many of Gregory’s 
deeper concerns. In order to demonstrate the fundamentally unitive 
character of Gregory’s Christology, I focus here on the speciﬁ c question 
of whether biblical references to Christ ultimately refer to one or two 
subjects.9 One Acting Subject
Before we consider the more technical aspects of the problem, we 
should ﬁ rst observe the most typical way in which Gregory speaks of 
Christ. Throughout his corpus, Gregory often refers simply to “Christ” 
being and doing a wide variety of things, both apart from and in the in-
carnation. A passage in his ﬁ rst oration sets the pattern:
Let us become like Christ, since Christ became like us. Let us be-
come gods for his sake, since he for ours became human. He as-
sumed the worse, so that he might give away the better. He became 
poor, so that we through his poverty might become rich. He took 
the form of a servant, so that we might receive back our freedom. He descended, so that we might be exalted. He was tempted, so 
that we might conquer.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=121
122,"He became 
poor, so that we through his poverty might become rich. He took 
the form of a servant, so that we might receive back our freedom. He descended, so that we might be exalted. He was tempted, so 
that we might conquer. He was dishonored, so that he might glo-
rify us. He died, so that he might save us. He ascended, so that he 
might draw us to himself, who were lying low in the fall of sin. Let 
us give all, let us offer all to him who gave himself as a ransom and 
an exchange for us. (Or. 1.5)
100 Christopher A. Beeley Here it is simply “Christ” who exists before the incarnation, becomes 
human to save us, and continues to calls us as the risen Lord, with no 
explicit differentiation between the eternal Son of God and the human 
Jesus of Nazareth, or between Christ’s divine and human natures. While fervent devotion to Christ is of course to be expected from a 
Christian bishop, and Gregory is for the most part reﬂ ecting the lan-
guage of the New Testament and the Nicene Creed, there is more here 
than meets the eye. In 362, at the beginning of his career, Gregory is 
aware of the christological controversies that have racked the church 
since the 320s, and he is concerned in all of his work to articulate an or-
thodox doctrine of Christ. His simple predication of various statements 
to the one Christ is both meaningful and deliberate, and there are nu-
merous other passages in the pre-Constantinopolitan orations (from 
362 to 379) which bear the same stamp. It is “Jesus,” Gregory says, who 
both created us and became human for us (Or. 14.2). When the Old Tes-
tament saints knew God through the Logos which was presented to 
their minds, their faith was “in Christ” (Or. 15.1). “Christ” created the 
great heritage of the church, and he also inherits it (Or. 4.67). And so 
Gregory considers a wide range of titles, from “God” to “human being,” 
all to be “the titles and powers of Christ” (Or. 2.98).10 It is noteworthy that as Gregory’s involvement in these controver-
sies deepens, he does not come to regard this simpler kind of reference 
as an inferior or no longer sufﬁ cient way of speaking; in fact, such state-
ments are more prevalent during and after his time in Constantinople, 
when he dealt with sophisticated opponents in increasingly technical 
ways. In an early oration in the capital, for example, it is “Christ” who 
does miracles in the Old and New Testaments (Or. 24.10).11",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=122

does miracles in the Old and New Testaments (Or. 24.10).11 In the hot-
test moments of trinitarian debate during the summer of 380, Gregory 
speaks of “Christ’s bodily dwelling” on earth (Or. 41.5). And in the ﬁ fth 
Theological Oration, he writes that all things have been created “through 
Christ,” even though the exegetical context of John 1:3 would make it 
more natural to say “through the Logos” (Or. 31.12). While the Theo-
logical Orations otherwise lack such references,12 since Gregory is re-
sponding to Eunomian and Pneumatomachian objections with consis-
tently high precision, the pattern continues soon afterward. He opens 
one of his most important orations on Christ by declaring that “Jesus”
Gregory of Nazianzus on the Unity of Christ 101
humbled himself and became human to save us from the “unsettled 
and bitter waves of life” (Or. 37.1). Even more strikingly, he adds that 
Jesus travels from place to place, though he is uncontained by any 
place—“the timeless, the bodiless, the uncircumscript, the same who 
was and is . . . . He was in the beginning with God and was God” (John 
1:3)—all predicated of “Jesus” rather than the eternal Word, again de-
spite an exegetical incentive to do so (Or. 37.2).13 
Perhaps the most striking instance comes in the triptych of ser-
mons that Gregory delivered in the Church of the Holy Apostles for 
Christmas/Epiphany 380/81 (Or. 38–40)—a set of texts as doctrinally 
signiﬁ cant as the more famous Theological Orations. As the new arch-
bishop, Gregory presided over the Epiphany baptisms and delivered 
the mystagogical catechesis in the presence of the new emperor, pos-
sibly the conquered Gothic chieftain Athanaric, and Gregory’s former 
theological rivals. He opens the series in a stream of liturgical praise: 
Christ is born—glorify him! Christ is come from heaven—rise up 
to meet him! Christ is on earth—be exalted! “Sing to the Lord, all 
the earth!” (Ps 95:1 LXX)",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=123
124,"He opens the series in a stream of liturgical praise: 
Christ is born—glorify him! Christ is come from heaven—rise up 
to meet him! Christ is on earth—be exalted! “Sing to the Lord, all 
the earth!” (Ps 95:1 LXX) And to say them both together: “Let the 
heavens rejoice and the earth be glad” (Ps 95:11 LXX) because the 
heavenly one now dwells on earth. Christ is in the ﬂ esh—rejoice 
with trembling and joy! (Or. 38.1)14
More explicitly than usual, Gregory again refers both heavenly and 
earthly statements to Christ. The ultimate cause of Christian praise and 
joy, he declares, is that the one Christ has come from heaven to earth for 
our salvation: thus begins this important set of festal homilies. The sec-
ond and third homilies begin similarly: “Again my Jesus . . . the true 
light who enlightens every person who comes into the world (John 1:9)” 
and who restores the light that he originally gave us from above at the 
beginning of creation (Or. 39.1); and “my Christ” created us, became in-
carnate, was baptized, and rose from the dead for us, honoring all three 
types of human birth in his own person (par j eJautou', Or. 40.2). Greg-
ory hardly repeats this practice in the body of the sermons,15 but the 
more technical forms of argument found there serve to represent and 
make sense of the simpler confessional statements with which he began. 102 Christopher A. Beeley The pattern can also be found in Gregory’s last three orations, delivered 
in Cappadocia in 382 and 383,16 thus spanning his entire career. Yet of course Gregory has plenty more to say about Christ’s iden-
tity, and he mounts an advanced, technical Christology in several places. Although he rarely explains his theological method in such detail, the 
debates in Constantinople led him to give an explicit deﬁ nition of his 
practice of christological exegesis. Gregory’s clearest statement of chris-
tological method thus comes not in his late epistles, but in the heart of 
the Theological Orations, delivered in July–August 380. In the Con-
stantinopolitan period Gregory typically combines his various oppo-
nents under the most extreme position of the heterousian theologian 
Eunomius of Cyzicus, whom he believes represents the fundamental 
logic of the rest. In the third and fourth Theological Orations (Or. 29–30) 
he responds to the Eunomians’ objections to the full divinity of the 
Son.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=124

he responds to the Eunomians’ objections to the full divinity of the 
Son. After answering a series of logical objections in Or. 29.3–16 and 
before turning to biblical objections in Or. 30.1–16,17 Gregory gives a 
brief statement of his own doctrine of Christ based on Scripture and a 
 descriptive account of his method of christological exegesis in Or. 
29.17–20—one of the most important christological passages in his cor-
pus. He offers the following rule of biblical interpretation and christo-
logical reference:
Apply the loftier passages to his Divinity, to the nature that is su-
perior to passivities and the body, and apply the lowlier passages to 
the composite one (oJ suvnqeto~), to him who for your sake emptied 
himself and became ﬂ esh and, to say it no worse, was made human, 
and afterwards was also exalted. (Or. 29.18) The key to interpreting the various things that are said about Christ, 
Gregory says, is to understand that the more exalted and the humbler 
statements refer to the same Son of God, though in different ways. In 
order to answer Eunomian arguments against the full divinity of Christ, 
Gregory distinguishes purely divine statements about Christ from those 
which describe him in his incarnate state. Grander titles like “God,” 
“Word” (John 1:1), and “Christ the power of God and the wisdom of 
God” (1 Cor 1:24) refer to Christ’s identity as the divine Son of God in
Gregory of Nazianzus on the Unity of Christ 103
his eternal relationship with the Father, which Gregory signiﬁ es here 
with the shorthand term “his Divinity. ”18 On the other hand, lowlier 
expressions like “slave,” “he hungered,” and “he wept” (Phil 2:7; Matt 
4:2; John 11:35)—and above all his cross and death—refer to the Son of 
God who has assumed human existence in the person of Jesus and is 
now “composite.”",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=125

God who has assumed human existence in the person of Jesus and is 
now “composite.” Thus when Wisdom—now generally assumed to be 
the Son—says in Prov 8:22, “The Lord created me as a beginning of his 
ways,” this is not a statement about the Son in his pre-incarnate condi-
tion, as if to say without qualiﬁ cation that the Word of the Father is a 
creature. Rather, the Son as Wisdom is proleptically making a state-
ment about his future incarnation, or composite state, in which he 
 becomes also a creature of God, the human being Jesus. By referring 
the lesser sayings to the Son in his incarnate form, Gregory is able to 
counter the claim that such texts prove that the Son is in himself a crea-
ture and therefore not fully divine. At the same time—and central to our purposes here—when Greg-
ory distinguishes between unqualiﬁ ed and qualiﬁ ed references to 
Christ, he is saying that both kinds of statements refer to the same Son of 
God. While the lofty sayings refer to the Son without qualiﬁ cation, the 
lowly ones refer to the same Son with the qualiﬁ cation that he is now 
the incarnate, human Lord. In other words, Gregory’s rule of interpre-
tation is as much a deﬁ nition of the unity and unchanging identity of 
the Son of God in his eternal and incarnate states as it is a distinction 
between those states—a point which is central to his doctrine of Christ 
as a whole. Yet, as we have noted, Gregory has been variously inter-
preted on just this question of whether there is a fundamental unity or 
a fundamental duality in Christ. In this passage he has been taken to be

tributes, with biblical statements being referred to two distinct subjects.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=126

English translation of the Theological Orations, by Browne and Swal-
low. The phrase in question reads: “the composite condition of him 
who for your sakes made himself of no reputation. ”19 According to this 
reading, lowly statements refer to the composite (incarnate) condition 
of the Son, that is, to Christ’s humanity as distinct from his divinity, 
rather than referring to the Son himself in human form. Thus Gregory
104 Christopher A. Beeley
is seen as advancing a scheme of double predication which divides the 
statements between distinct ﬁ nal referents. However, the Greek text 
does not support this reading. The parallel dative construction tw'/ 
 sunqevtw kai; tw'/ dia; se; kenwqevnti makes it clear that oJ suvnqeto~ 
means “the one who is composite” (in parallel with “the one who emp-
tied himself”), namely, the Son of God who is incarnate, rather than 
“the composite condition” of the Son of God.20 The correct reading is 
supported by the second instance in the Theological Orations where 
Gregory gives his hermeneutical rule. Here, the “lowlier and more 
human” expressions refer to “the New Adam, God made passible in 
order to defeat sin” (Or. 30.1), that is, to the eternal Son of God in his 
human form as the New Adam. Gregory is therefore not saying that 
the lofty sayings refer to the Son’s divinity and the lowly sayings to his 
humanity; nor is he distinguishing between Christ’s pre-incarnate and 
incarnate states, as if the lofty expressions referred to him before the in-
carnation and the lowly ones referred to him in the incarnation. Rather,

ory’s hermeneutical rule in a dualist fashion, assuming predication to 
two different subjects or two distinct phases of Christ’s career, misses 
his meaning entirely. At this central point of his career, when he is 
pressed to give an account of his christological method, Gregory both 
assumes and advances a doctrine of the unity and unchanging identity 
of the Son of God in his eternal and his incarnate states. So deeply embedded is the unity of Christ in Gregory’s thought 
that it leads him to push the Eunomians beyond what appears to be 
their actual position. In his extant works Eunomius argues against 
the full divinity of Christ on the basis of texts that refer to the pre- 
incarnate Son—so that the Son of God is already a creature, apart from 
the  incarnation—and there is no indication that he ever appealed to 
Jesus’ lowly, human status per se. It is Gregory who presses the Eu-
nomians to that point. After listing several texts that Eunomius has 
cited,21 Gregory then adds further sayings that refer not to the Son’s 
pre-incarnate condition, but speciﬁ cally to his lowly, human status:
Gregory of Nazianzus on the Unity of Christ 105 If you want, list also “slave” and “obedient,” “he gave,” “he learned” 
(Phil 2:7, 8; Jn 18:9; Hb 5:8) . . . . Or add sayings that are even low-
lier than these, like the fact that he slept, was hungry, got tired, 
wept, was in agony, was subjected (Mt 8:24; 4:2; Jn 4:6; 11:35; Lk 
22:44; 1 Cor 15:28)—maybe you even reproach him for his cross 
and death! (Or. 29.18) Gregory is suggesting that if texts like Proverbs 8:22 indicate the Son’s 
created status, how much more do his hunger, tears, and death on the 
cross.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=128

created status, how much more do his hunger, tears, and death on the 
cross. The hidden premise is that both kinds of statement refer to the 
same subject, a point that Gregory tacitly assumes and Eunomius seems 
to have held as well. 22 If Christ was composed of two different subjects, 
then the humble passages that Gregory raises could simply be attrib-
uted to the human Jesus as distinct from the pre-incarnate or eternal 
Son, and they would not stand as proof against his divinity at all. But, 
signiﬁ cantly, Gregory does not do this. He extends the Eunomian posi-
tion to include all biblical statements about Christ’s creaturely status—
pre-incarnate and incarnate—to which he counters that the lowly, 
cruciﬁ ed Christ “is for us true God and on the same level with the Fa-
ther” (Or. 29.18). To be sure, Gregory is also making the second point 
that such texts refer to the Son in a different way—in the incarnation, 
or “economically” (29.18)—but the whole point of his method of predi-
cation is to confess that the cruciﬁ ed Lord is the eternal Son of God. Nowhere in this passage does he avoid the Eunomian objection by sepa-
rating human from divine referents. In fact, as the next section shows, 
his argument runs in the opposite direction: the very one whom the Eu-
nomians scorn is none other than the merciful and humble Lord who 
was cruciﬁ ed for our salvation (Or. 29.19). In this important passage, 
Gregory advances the unity of Christ as a single subject of reference 
both in the way he sets up the problem and in the christological method 
that he goes on to deﬁ ne. As a climactic conclusion to his argument, Gregory illustrates the 
singularity of Christ in one of his most beautiful passages. With great 
rhetorical skill and liturgical sensibility, he recites a litany of seemingly 
contrary acts of the one Christ, paired in matching antitheses:
106 Christopher A. Beeley He was begotten [ejgennhvqh], yet he was also born [gegevnnhto]23

incarnate, some incarnate—Gregory pairs a corresponding action that 
he accomplishes as a human being, so that it is the same Son of God 
who does them all. As he comments, the Son does some things “as 
God,” things which only God can do (whether or not in human form), 
such as rising from the dead, forgiving sins, and destroying death; while 
others he does “as a human being,” such as praying, being hungry, and 
dying—things which all of us do apart from God’s saving work, and 
which characterize the condition that the Son came to heal and save. The hermeneutical rule that Gregory gives in Or. 29.18 provides a 
rubric for his overall understanding of Christ’s identity. In the follow-
ing section he gives a brief but telling account of Christ, still addressed 
to the Eunomians: The one whom you now scorn was once above you [uJpe;r sev]. The

erful prevailed [over his assumed humanity], so that we might be

29.19) As Frederick Norris has observed—and similar to Brian Daley’s analy-
sis of Gregory of Nyssa’s Christology—Gregory Nazianzen’s under-
standing of Christ is deﬁ ned primarily within the broader framework 
of the economy of salvation as a whole.27 At a particular point in time, 
Gregory argues, the divine Son of God, who was previously incom-
posite (ajsuvnqeto~) and not mingled with his creation, took upon him-
self our created, human existence—a form of existence radically differ-
ent from his own—and became composite (suvnqeto~, Or. 29.18) in 
order to save us. While remaining the divine Son of God (“what he was, 
he continued to be”) he has now also become a human creature (“what 
he was not, he assumed”). Moreover, because the eternal being of the 
Son is that of the Creator God, his divine nature predominates over his 
new, creaturely form and gives primary identity to it. Even though God 
and human existence are ontologically distinct, the difference between 
them is so great that the incarnate Christ is not two distinct things, but 
a single entity (e|i~) as before, only now in a composite state. Gregory 
does not imagine Christ as a God-man existing in a kind of personal 
duality or ontological balance; this is not what he means by composition 
or synthesis. Rather, he understands Christ to be the Son of God in the 
most fundamental sense, even in the incarnation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=131

Apollinarians were accused of holding;28 nor because the Spirit eter-
nally anoints the Son, making him Christ even in his divinity, as Greg-
ory of Nyssa held;29 but because Christ is himself the Son of God made 
human. On account of his transtemporal identity, which for Gregory of 
Nazianzus goes well beyond a mere communicatio idiomatum—accord-

are merely predicated of the other term but do not reﬂ ect an actual on-
tological state, such as the Antiochenes held—everything that the Son 
does Christ does, and vice versa. In the major orations from 379 on, Gregory deﬁ nes Christ’s iden-
tity within the same unitive, economic framework, making the Son the 
ultimate referent of Christ’s divine and human acts.30 The opening sec-
tions of Oration 37, from late 380, are an important example: The one who is uncontained moves from place to place—he who is 
timeless, bodiless, uncircumscript, who was and is, who was both 
above time and came under time, who was invisible and is seen. He 
was in the beginning and was with God and was God (Jn 1:1) . . . . What he was he set aside; what he was not he assumed. Not that he 
became two things, but he deigned to be made one thing out of 
two [ouj duvo genovmeno~, ajll j e}n ejk tw'n duvo genevsqai ajnascovmeno~]. For both are God, that which assumed and that which was as-
sumed, the two natures meeting in one thing [duvo fuvsei~ eij~ e}n

the blending [hJ suvgkrasi~].",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=132

With apologies for the difﬁ culty of expressing such thoughts—“Pardon 
my speech: I am speaking of the greatest things with a limited 
instrument!”— Gregory labors to explain that the limited, human Sav-
ior is the visible form of the invisible God, who has himself taken on 
our life in a single, compound entity. The opening sections of Oration 37 
remind us again that Gregory often expresses his Christology in the 
simpler terms that we ﬁ rst examined. 32 The same holds true in the great 
Epiphany sermons, where he begins with simple language—“Christ is 
born . . . Christ from heaven . . . Christ on earth” (Or. 38.1)—and then 
goes on to give a more reﬁ ned exposition of the same basic idea. The 
fullest statement comes in Oration 38.13 (= 45.9), which is then echoed 
more brieﬂ y in Orations 39–40: the incomprehensible and invisible 
Word of God himself “came to his own image and took on himself ﬂ esh 
for the sake of our ﬂ esh and mingled himself with an intelligent soul 
for my soul’s sake, purifying like by like, and in all ways except sin was 
made human.” As Gregory explains, in terms similar to Or. 37.2 above,
Gregory of Nazianzus on the Unity of Christ 109
this means that the one born of Mary is “God together with what 
he  assumed, one thing made out of two opposites [e{n ejk duvo tw'n ejnan-
tivwn], ﬂ esh and Spirit, of which the latter deiﬁ es and the former is dei-
ﬁ ed.” As in Or. 29.19, then, Gregory deﬁ nes Christ as the eternal Word 
of God who has taken on a complete human form, “mingling” himself 
with our condition so intimately that his divine nature uniﬁ es and most 
fundamentally characterizes Jesus’ identity, even in its human element, 
so as to make him truly “one thing” (e{n).33 This unitive, narrative chris-
tological framework pervades Gregory’s corpus and remains funda-
mental to his doctrine throughout his career. In the late christological 
epistles, for example, he argues that initially (provteron)",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=133

epistles, for example, he argues that initially (provteron) God the Son 
existed entirely separate from the temporal economy of salvation (movnon 
kai; proaiwvnion), but that ﬁ nally (ejpi; tevlei) he became also a human 
being (Ep. 101.13–14). Again, the Son of God is eternally begotten of 
the Father, “and after this” (kai; meta; tou'to) was born of the Virgin 
Mary (Ep. 102.4). In all of these passages the cruciﬁ ed Jesus is under-
stood primarily as the Son of God, making the apostolic confessions 
“Jesus Christ the Son of God” (Mark 1:1) and “Christ is Lord” (1 Cor 
12:2) true and accurate—even if counterintuitive—statements of his 
identity. More prevalent than the technical deﬁ nitions given in Or. 29.19 
and 37.4, however, are the numerous passages where Gregory simply 
speaks of God, or the Son of God, as the one who underwent the human 
experiences of Christ. In his ﬁ rst major christological statement in Con-
stantinople, Gregory insists on the confession that God was born and 
died and rose for us, and he severely criticizes those who avoid such 
vivid language (Or. 22.13). Likewise, in his poem against Apollinarius, 
written in 382/83, he argues that it is essential that “God was conceived 
and born” (Carm. 1.1.10.22) and that 
God came to an end as man, to honor me,
so that by the very things he took on, he might restore,
and destroy sin’s accusation utterly,
and, by dying, slaughter the slaughterer. (Carm. 1.1.10.6–9)34

For Gregory (as for all the orthodox Fathers), the focus and climax of 
Christ’s saving work is his death on the cross. He frequently speaks 
of God—a single subject—dying on the cross for our salvation. “We 
needed a God made ﬂ esh and put to death, so that we might live,” he 
writes in his ﬁ nal Easter oration in Cappadocia, and so “God is cruci-
ﬁ ed” (Or. 45.28–29).35 Gregory is so intent on proclaiming God’s direct 
involvement in Christ’s human life and death that he even uses lan-
guage that some believed threatens to contradict the fundamental dis-
tinction between God and created beings, terms that Gregory of Nyssa 
also uses,36 and which would later become suspect for their Apollinar-
ian associations. The impassible Son of God, Gregory says, is “mingled” 
(mivgnutai) with human suffering and the immortal one with human 
corruptibility. So real is the Son’s assumption of fallen human existence 
in the incarnation that when the Devil attacks Jesus, he unwittingly 
meets with God, and death is defeated by death (Or. 39.13). The soteriological signiﬁ cance of Christ’s divine identity is clearest 
at the greatest point of his suffering, as he cries from the cross, “My 
God, my God, look upon me, why have you forsaken me?” (Ps 21:1 
LXX; cf. Matt 27:46). For Gregory, Jesus’ cry of dereliction does not in-
dicate that God has abandoned him, in which case there would cer-
tainly be two subjects involved: Christ has not been abandoned either 
by the Father or by his own divinity—as if God were afraid of suffer-
ing! Rather, Jesus’ ultimate desolation conveys just how authentically 
the Son has assumed and represented (tupou'n) our fallen condition, 
“making our thoughtlessness and waywardness his own” (Or. 30.5). Jesus’ cry of abandonment, in other words, does not reﬂ ect the absence 
of God in his suffering, but rather reﬂ ects God’s inclusion of our aban-
donment within his saving embrace and his healing presence in the 
midst of the suffering and death that our sin has brought about.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=135

suffering shows just how great God’s love for us is, because in him God 
has died in order to forgive our sins (Or. 33.14). In Gregory’s view, it is 
not enough for God to associate himself with human existence without 
actually becoming human: the Son himself must assume and undergo 
human suffering and death in order to purify like by like (Ep. 101.51). Gregory therefore deﬁ nes Christ as “God made passible for our sake 
against sin” (Or. 30.1),37 and—keenly aware of the paradox involved—
Gregory of Nazianzus on the Unity of Christ 111
he declares that we are “saved by the sufferings of the impassible one” 
(ta; tou' ajpaqou'~ pavqei~, Or. 30.5).38 Thus for Gregory the awesome na-
ture of the Christian faith is quite literally “to see God cruciﬁ ed” (Or. 
43.64). He emphasizes the point in the ﬁ nal sections of his last oration: 
“We needed an incarnate God, a God put to death, so that we might 
live; and we were put to death with him” (Or. 45.28). Because it was 
God who died on the cross—the Son of God made human just for this 
purpose—then his death can be the death of all fallen humanity, and 
we can be puriﬁ ed and made a new creation by his divine life. 39

basis of a handful of texts in which he seems to be saying just the oppo-

order to avoid christological error, the human Jesus, or Christ’s hu-
manity, must be conceived as a subject of existence distinct from the 
eternal Son of God. Although in certain passages he follows the pattern 
of single-subject predication outlined in Or. 29.18 and 30.1, in others he 
practices a kind of double predication, referring certain things to 
Christ’s humanity in a way that appears to be independent of his di-
vinity. Some of these passages resolve themselves into the single-subject 
paradigm,40 such as Or. 30.2, where Gregory considers the interpreta-
tion of Proverbs 8:22 and provides yet another instance of his herme-
neutical rule. Gregory comments that whatever has to do with Christ’s 
being caused, such as the term “created,” must refer to his humanity 
(hJ ajnqrwpovth~), whereas whatever is simple and uncaused refers to his 
Divinity (hJ qeovth~). The question is whether Gregory means Christ’s 
human nature per se, as a subject of existence other than the Son of 
God, or whether he means the Son of God in his human form, as in Or. 
29.18 and 30.1. At the end of the section he plainly indicates the latter, 
saying that Wisdom (the divine subject) is called these things in dif-
ferent respects. 41
112 Christopher A. Beeley Yet there are other passages that do not resolve themselves so neatly 
into the unitive scheme. 42 In Or. 30.16, for example, Gregory argues 
that statements about Christ’s human acts—such as keeping God’s 
com mandments (John 15:10; cf. 10:18; 12:49), learning obedience 
through suffering (Heb 5:8), and the agony of his passion (Heb 5:7; 
Luke 22:44)—refer to “the passible element, not the immutable nature 
that is far above passion.”43 Rather than referring the lowly passages to 
the Son of God in his human form, as in Or. 29.18 and 30.1, Gregory’s 
point here seems to be that they do not refer to God at all, but rather to 
Jesus’ humanity as distinct from his divinity, thus positively resisting 
single-subject predication.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=137

scribes Christ as being dual or double. In his reply to Eunomian argu-
ments from John 14:28 and 20:17—“the Father is greater than I” and “I 
am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your 
God”—Gregory explains that while the Father is Father of the Word, 
God is not the God of the Word, “because he was two-fold [diplou'~].” What misleads heretics, he says, is a failure to appreciate just this du-
ality, and to realize that even though Christ’s divine and human titles 
are “yoked together on account of the mixture [hJ suvgkrasi~],” never-
theless “the natures are distinguished and the names are separated in 
our thoughts . . . . Even though the combination of [God and human 
existence] is a single entity, he is such not in his [divine] nature [alone], 
but in the union of the two” (Or. 30.8).44 As above, Gregory appears to 
be saying that the key to understanding Christ’s identity is to distin-
guish his two natures from one another as distinct referents and sub-
jects of existence. 45 In light of such passages, one might indeed be led 
to agree with Grillmeier that Gregory’s Christology is “very Anti-
ochene.” The challenge that these passages pose runs to the heart of Grego-
ry’s soteriology. In his view, God created human beings into a process of 
“divinization” (qevwsi~), a dynamic condition of eschatological growth 
into the likeness of God and toward the union of the soul with the Trin-
ity.46 However, in the sin of Adam we fell into a condition of sin and 
death, from which we are unable to save ourselves.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=138

lish our divinization, God therefore sent his only Son to become human 
and to suffer death on the cross. But for Gregory, Christ is not merely 
the instrumental cause of the divinization of others: he is himself the
Gregory of Nazianzus on the Unity of Christ 113
ﬁ rst instance and the paradigm of our salvation—the New Adam and 
the archetype of a renewed human race—because he is “God on earth” 
(Or. 29.19). Gregory argues that sin and death could be defeated and the 
process of divinization restarted only if God took on our condition and 
healed it from within. Christ is the constitutive principle of salvation 
precisely because he is most fundamentally the Son of God, who has as-
sumed our fallen condition as his own. The unity of Christ as a single 
entity (e{n, ei|~)—with his human existence given the fullest possible ar-
ticulation within his divine identity—is therefore the central tenet of 
Gregory’s soteriology and his Christology. As a signiﬁ cation of Christ’s 
saving work, we should expect that all of Christ’s human acts belong to 
the Son of God in his human form, or to his “economy” (Or. 29.18), just 
as his divine acts (before or in the incarnation) refer to the Son without 
economic qualiﬁ cation. The passages that seem to distinguish Jesus’ 
humanity from his divinity, as distinct referents and subjects of exis-
tence, must therefore be seen as threatening Gregory’s soteriology at its 
very core, so that it could no longer be said that in Christ God suffered, 
died, and rose from the dead for our salvation. There are several points to be made in response to this problem. First, we must observe that the single-subject paradigm is the most 
prevalent mode of christological reﬂ ection in Gregory’s work. Single-
subject constructions far outweigh dual ones, in both frequency and 
importance, in major and minor orations as well as in the dogmatic 
poems. Secondly, it is signiﬁ cant that the greatest concentration of ap-
parently dualist exegesis comes in the fourth Theological Oration—

29.17–21); we must now turn to the conclusion. At the end of the ora-
tion, Gregory returns to the subject with which he began in Or. 29.17, 
recapitulating his christological argument in a lengthy meditation on 
the names of God and Christ (Or. 30.17–21). He ﬁ rst discusses the Son’s 
lofty names—those which belong to him “both above us and for us,” 
and then turns to his lowly names—those which are “uniquely ours 
and which belong to what he assumed from us.” This second phrase 
might again suggest the dualist model: that the lowly names belong to 
Christ’s humanity as opposed to the eternal Son; here, however,  Gregory
114 Christopher A. Beeley
reemphasizes the unity of Christ’s human existence with his divine son-
ship. Christ is called “human being,” he says, to signify that the incom-
prehensible One is comprehended “through his body,” and that he 
sanctiﬁ es humanity “through himself”: in each case the eternal Son is 
the subject of Christ’s actions. Gregory also signals the unitive model by 
returning to his typical practice of using the term “nature” to refer pri-
marily to the divine being, which primarily deﬁ nes Christ’s identity. In 
the commentary that follows, Christ’s divine identity subsumes and 
 deﬁ nes his incarnate, human status. While he is a complete human 
 being—body, soul, and mind—Christ has united human existence to 
himself so fully that he is, in the truest sense, “God made visible to in-
tellectual perception” (qeo;~ oJrwvmeno~, dia; to; noouvmenon). And he is 
called “Christ” for the same reason: because in becoming human the 
 divine Son anoints his humanity through his complete presence as the 
anointer (parousiva/ de; o{lou tou' crivonto~), as opposed to the anointing 
of prophets and kings, which takes place merely by divine action 
(ejnergeiva/)—and which, we may add, occurs between two distinct enti-
ties.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=140

of the Son, both the lofty and the lowly, in a godly way (qei>kw'~). Even 
as we identify with Christ’s assumed, human qualities because they are 
our own (sumpaqw'~), by faith we come to see that these too belong to 
God (qei>kw'~ again), and in so doing we “ascend from below and be-
come God, because he came down from above for our sake” (Or. 30.21). In this dogmatic and spiritual tour de force, Oration 30 climactically re-
solves into the economic paradigm with which it began, framing the 
entire piece in a single-subject doctrine of Christ. The general pattern of Gregory’s corpus and the main argument of 
Or. 29.17–30.21 strongly suggest that the apparently dualistic passages 
be reconsidered within the economic paradigm. Either they must be 
susceptible to an economic interpretation, or they are deeply inconsis-
tent with Gregory’s larger christological project. To return to Or. 
30.16—the strongest such passage—we ﬁ nd that Gregory need not be 
saying that Jesus’ human and divine acts refer to two different subjects 
of existence. He is more likely saying that Christ’s human acts refer to 
“his passible element, not his immutable nature that is far above pas-
sion”:47 that the lowly passages refer to the human existence, or the 
human form, that the Son has assumed, while still being the Son of God

in that assumption, rather than to his own, divine nature per se, apart 
from the incarnation. Likewise, statements that Christ is “two-fold” 
(diplou'~, Or. 30.8, 38.13) need not mean anything other than what 
Gregory argues in Or. 29.18: that in the economy the Son is now “com-
posite” (suvnqeto~), and thus can be said to be and do human things on 
account of the human form that he has assumed. As it turns out, each 
of the apparently dualist texts can be thus interpreted within the eco-
nomic paradigm. What appears to be happening in Oration 30, with slight residual 
effects afterward, is the result of Gregory’s attempt to make his case for 
the unitive, economic paradigm as strongly as possible. As he addresses 
Eunomian exegesis—and by extension all subordinationist opposition 
to the Son’s full divinity—he ﬁ nds it necessary to add the qualiﬁ cation 
that, although they are God’s human actions, they must not be under-
stood as God’s actions apart from the incarnation. As important as it is 
that in Christ the Son of God died a human death, it is equally impor-
tant not to suggest that he died a divine death as well—that in the full-
ness of his being God died on the cross and therefore has ceased to be 
God; otherwise, the Eunomian position would have very much to rec-
ommend it indeed. In this regard, the single-subject, economic para-
digm is not only capable of accommodating such qualiﬁ cations, but it 
necessarily includes them, either explicitly or implicitly—whether they 
be fulsome accounts of Jesus’ humanity or statements that he possesses 
two elements or natures—without subverting the central claim that 
Christ’s identity is determined primarily by his divinity.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=142

contested passages ﬁ t perfectly well within Gregory’s unitive, economic 
structure, it would appear, then, that the confusion stems not from the 
potential contradiction of certain texts, but rather from a presupposed 
christological dualism on the part of the interpreter. If one has a full, 
economic understanding of Christ’s unity, as Gregory does, then it 
makes perfect sense to speak of certain things as belonging to Christ’s 
humanity as distinct from his divinity, so long as one assumes that the 
ultimate subject of Christ’s human actions is the eternal Son of God; 
and it is unnecessary—indeed it would be tiresome—to spell this out 
every time. Gregory’s Christology is therefore dualist only if one as-
sumes that the unitive, economic paradigm is not in force, which means
116 Christopher A. Beeley
that on closer examination the dualist reading very much begs the ques-
tion. Finally, we may speculate that the prevalence of the dualist view 
stems in part from scholars’ relying too heavily on Oration 30 and study-
ing the Theological Orations in isolation—or possibly only with the 
christological epistles—rather than interpreting them within the larger 
context of Gregory’s corpus. Conclusion For reasons central to his understanding of salvation and the Christian 
life, Gregory of Nazianzus consistently and deliberately maintains a 
unitive Christology. Christ’s identity as the divine Son of God who has 
become human as a single subject of existence is the central tenet of 
Gregory’s doctrine of Christ and the essential expression of his soteriol-
ogy. His common practice of referring both lofty and lowly sayings 
simply to “Christ” is a coherent reﬂ ection of this unitive scheme.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=143

cause the incarnate, human Lord is in his fundamental identity the 
eternal Son of God, it is not only permissible to say that Christ created 
us as well as redeemed us, but by keeping the focus on the incarnate 
Christ as the one in whom Christians know God in the power of the 
Holy Spirit, it is in a sense more faithful to do so. Moreover, the unitive 
doctrine examined here helps us to see that Gregory is the main source 
of the deepest principles of Cyril of Alexandria’s Christology,48 and, 
through others such as Maximus Confessor, a large measure of subse-
quent christological orthodoxy. Gregory’s doctrine is not fundamen-
tally Antiochene, anti-Apollinarian,49 or in any other sense dualistic, as 
has been alleged; and rather than compromising the integrity of Christ’s 
human existence, it gives a compelling, traditional account of its real 
meaning. Notes 1. Brian E. Daley, S.J., “Divine Transcendence and Human Transforma-

Two Early Nicenes
Eustathius of Antioch and Marcellus of Ancyra
Kelley McCarthy Spoerl
T
he controversy set off by Arius of Alexandria in the second decade 
of the fourth century continues to generate important scholarship. While Athanasius of Alexandria has received the lion’s share of atten-
tion, in recent years attention has also shifted to other supporters and 
opponents of Arius, notably, Marcellus of Ancyra, an opponent of 
Arius, and Eusebius of Caesarea, at least at one time a supporter of the 
Alexandria presbyter. Moreover, scholarship on these ﬁ gures has dem-
onstrated that the conﬂ icts between supporters and opponents of Arius 
before and during the Council of Nicea in 325 continued to play out in 
the decades that followed, signiﬁ cantly shaping developments in trini-
tarian theology and Christology as the century progressed. José Declerck’s magisterial new edition makes it possible to con-
sider in detail another early opponent of Arius: Eustathius of Antioch.1 In this essay I provide an overview of Eustathius’s career in the pre- 
and post-Nicene period and a survey of his trinitarian and christo-
logical views. I then compare Eustathius’s views with those of Marcellus
122 Kelley McCarthy Spoerl
of Ancyra, the understanding of whose theology has advanced tremen-
dously in recent years through the publication of several important edi-
tions and monographs. A comparative examination of the thought of 
these two ﬁ gures proves useful for two reasons: (1) it illuminates the 
kinship between thinkers who belonged to an identiﬁ able early pro-
Nicene coalition, as well as their notable differences, revealing that this 
coalition was by no means monolithic; (2) by establishing the similari-
ties between the thought of Eustathius and Marcellus in both trinitar-
ian and christological areas, as well as their shared enmity with Eusebius 
of Caesarea, it provides context for the emergence later in the century 
of signiﬁ cant heresy from within the same pro-Nicene coalition, no-
tably in the thought of Apollinarius of Laodicea. Eustathius’s Life and Career
Details about Eustathius’s life and career are scanty and inconsistent. According to Jerome’s De viris inlustribus, he was a Pamphilian from 
the city of Side;2 Athanasius3 and Theodoret4 say that he was a confes-
sor, presumably during the Diocletian persecutions from 303 to 313.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=151

the city of Side;2 Athanasius3 and Theodoret4 say that he was a confes-
sor, presumably during the Diocletian persecutions from 303 to 313. Theodoret says that by the time of the outbreak of controversy over the 
teachings of Arius in Alexandria, Eustathius was bishop of Beroea 
(modern-day Aleppo) in Syria; he received a warning letter from Alex-
ander of Alexandria about Arius’s teaching.5 At some point after the 
death of Philogonius, bishop of Antioch (ca. 323), Eustathius was trans-
lated to that city.6 He then participated in the Antiochene synod that 
took place in late 324 or early 325, wherein Eusebius of Caesarea, Theo-
dotus of Laodicea, and Narcissus of Neronias were placed under provi-
sional ban until the ecumenical synod that summer.7 As we now know, 
the great council that eventually took place at Nicea was originally 
going to meet in Marcellus’s see of Ancyra.8 Marcellus does not seem to 
have been present at the synod of Antioch at which Eustathius was 
present. However, Logan speculates that it was Marcellus who sug-
gested the line of questioning over the existence of one or two oujsivai in 
the Christian godhead that Ossius took with Eusebius of Caesarea in an 
effort to smoke out his Arian sympathies.9 Even before Nicea, Eu-

stathius made evident his anti-Arian sympathies and his hostility to Eu-
sebius of Caesarea, and he was part of an informal alliance against the 
Arian threat that included Ossius of Cordoba, Alexander of Alexan-
dria, and Marcellus of Ancyra. Furthermore, Athanasius credits Eu-
stathius with driving out of the diocese during his tenure a number of 
allies of Arius.10 Eustathius participated at the council of Nicea, and

gaged in a pamphlet war with Eusebius of Caesarea, whose dishonesty 
about his confession of faith at Nicea Eustathius denounces. 12 The conﬂ ict came to a head at the provincial synod of the diocese of 
Coele-Syria in the fall of 327, when Eustathius was deposed. The causes 
for Eustathius’s deposition vary: doctrinal reasons (Sabellianism),13 a 
breach of clerical discipline (Theodoret’s story of a woman slapping 
Eustathius with an ill-timed paternity suit),14 and a treasonous violation 
of imperial etiquette (making disparaging remarks about Constantine’s 
mother Helena).15 Two reports about this event are of particular inter-
est. First, Socrates claims that he has the report that Eustathius was de-
posed for Sabellianism from George of Laodicea in his encomium of 
Eusebius of Emesa, an author of later anti-Marcellan treatises. 16 Sec-
ondly, Theodoret says that in cooperation with Theodotus of Laodicea, 
Eusebius of Caesarea, initiator of the literary tradition of treatises  contra 
Marcellum, led the charge against Eustathius at the synod.17

Caesarea was suggested as a possible replacement after Paulinus’s death, 
but, mindful of the Nicene ban on the translation of bishops, he refused 
the appointment. Later, Flacillus, dedicatee of Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical 
Theology, the Caesarean bishop’s most complete refutation of the theol-
ogy of Marcellus of Ancyra, took over the see.21

Eustathius’s fate after his deposition is uncertain. His deposition 
brought with it exile from the empire. Theodoret22 says that he went 
to a city of Illyricum in Thrace, while Jerome states that he went to 
Trajanopolis. 23 Philostorgius reports that he was sent into exile eij~ th;n
124 Kelley McCarthy Spoerl
 JEspevran “into the west.”24 The date of Eustathius’s death is equally un-
clear. Socrates speaks of his appearance in Constantinople in 363 and 
renewed banishment to Bizya, another city of Thrace. 25 Theodoret 
says that Eustathius died before the election of Meletius to the see of 
Antioch, which would place his death before 361.26 R. P. C. Hanson, 
however, speculates that that it is unlikely Eustathius could have sur-
vived that late into the fourth century and concludes that Eustathius 
must have died in exile before 337.27 In the wake of Eustathius’s deposi-
tion, his followers seceded from the community under his successors, 
and the Antiochene church remained divided into the ﬁ fth century. 28 
From the survey of evidence above, it is clear that Eustathius had a 
well-attested feud with Eusebius of Caesarea, anti-Marcellan polemi-
cist par excellence, both before and after Nicea, and that Eusebius was 
instrumental in eventually bringing Eustathius down, replacing him 
with the dedicatee of his most comprehensive anti-Marcellan work. Eustathius seems to have been regarded thereafter as a bête noir in the 
anti-Marcellan tradition. 29 At the same time that Eustathius was bat-
tling with Eusebius, he was on the same side of the debates as Marcellus 
before, during, and after Nicea. While the exact nature of their rela-
tions is unclear, Sara Parvis speculates that Eustathius’s deposition at 
the hands of Eusebius and Paulinus of Tyre outraged Marcellus.30 It is 
a fact that Marcellus himself was deposed in 336 by a similar-minded

Eustathius’s Trinitarian Theology—Survey and 
Comparison with Marcellus
A survey of the extant fragments deemed authentic and the short trea-
tise against Origen’s exegesis of the Witch of Endor episode in 1 Samuel 
amply supports ancient reports of Eustathius’s opposition to the theol-
ogy of Arius and the bishop of Antioch’s pro-Nicene convictions. A 
number of statements in the fragments even echo passages in the Nicene 
creed. Eustathius asserts that the second person of the Trinity is “true 
God” or “genuine Son of God.”32 He is not, as Arius notoriously con- Two Early Nicenes 125
tended, created out of nothing, but is begotten fuvsikw~ from the Fa-
ther.33 As God begotten from the Father, all things were created through 
him.34 The fragments also contain some references to the Nicene anath-
emas. In Fr. 19, Eustathius insinuates that Christ, having been born 
from the unchangeable divine nature, is unchangeable in his divine 
spirit.35 In Fr. 88, Eustathius asserts that there is only one uJpovstasi~ of 
divinity, as the Nicene anathema asserts. 36 What is lacking in Eustathius 
is any reference to the controversial Nicene watchword oJmoouvsion, 
though Eustathius does make one reference to the undeﬁ led oujsiva 
at Fr. 7837 and the divine substantia in Fr. 95.38 Elsewhere, in Fr. 21, 
 Eustathius asserts the singularity of the godhead (qeovth~).39 In some 
passages, Eustathius speaks about the divine nature40 and asserts that 
the second person of the Trinity is “Son of God by nature.”41 In Fr. 50, 
quoting Colossians 2:9, Eustathius asserts that as Son of God, the sec-
ond person is the “fullness of the godhead” and as such is perfect 
(tevleio~). 42
Interestingly, since it was one of Arius’s more notorious slogans, 
there is no direct evidence that Eustathius addressed the claim that 
“there was a time when [the Word/Son] was not.” He simply says in 
Fr. 65 that the Word and God was “from the ﬁ rst” (ajnevkaqen) with the 
 Father, the “beginning” attributed to him in Proverbs 8:22 referring 
to his human birth from the Virgin Mary.43",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=155

Word’s activity ajnevkaqen appears at Fr. 72, where Eustathius states that 
as Wisdom and Word, the second person has the power of rule 
 ajnevkaqen, rather than the human Jesus whom the Word assumed, who 
received it after his death and resurrection, as Peter proclaims in Acts 
2:36.44 Fr. 82 alludes to another issue contested in the early Arian con-
troversy. Eustathius says that the Word of God, “being God who was 
begotten from him [the Father],” does not have an extrinsic or newly 
acquired (ejpivkthto~) glory, though the “man of Christ,” that is, the 
man whom the Word assumes, does. 45 Eustathius thereby asserts that 
the second person enjoys glory in his preexistent state, which one would 
assume was on par with that of his Father. Eustathius’s titles for the second person of the Trinity vary. Aside 
from asserting that the second person is “true God,” Eustathius fre-
quently refers to him as the “Word and God.”46 But he also refers to
126 Kelley McCarthy Spoerl
him as “Son” and “Son of God,”47 and in one case as “most divine Son” 
(oJ qeiovtato~ uJiov~).48",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=156

(oJ qeiovtato~ uJiov~).48 It is clear from a number of fragments that Eu-
stathius applies the title “Son” to the preexistent second person of the 
Trinity, thereby indicating that the Son’s begetting takes place in his 
pre-incarnate existence.49 Indeed he says at Fr. 96 that the title “Son” 
belongs “properly” (decibiliter) to the God who dwells in the cruciﬁ ed 
man Jesus.50 A kindred term for “Son,” distinctive of Eustathius’s usage, 
is “child” (pai'~) of God, as in De Engastrimytho 23, where Eustathius 
asserts that only God and oJ qeiovtato~ aujtou' pai'~ had the authority to 
reclaim souls from hell. 51 In a statement that puts him in diametric op-
position to Marcellus, Eustathius in two fragments speaks of the preex-
istent Son of God as an image: in Fr. 68 as image of the Father,52 and in 
Fr. 95 as image of the divine substance. 53
De Engastrimytho, while mostly exegetical in nature, contains one 
passage where Eustathius makes some interesting remarks about the 
relationship between the Father and Son. I have described my overview 
here as focused on Eustathius’s “trinitarian” theology, but like many 
theologians in the ﬁ rst half of the fourth century, Eustathius conﬁ nes 
his reﬂ ections to the shared divinity of the Father and Son, giving scant 
attention to the Holy Spirit. 54 Consequently, there are no self-conscious 
references to “the Trinity” in the extant works of Eustathius. There is 
one reference to the “dyad” of Father and Son in De Engast. 24, where 
Eustathius gives an exegesis of Deuteronomy 13:1–3, concluding that 
“[Moses] showing here the Dyad of the Father and of the only-begotten 
Son, named one the Lord who tests, and the other besides this is the 
“beloved” Lord and God, so that from the Dyad, he might reveal the 
one godhead and the true divine begetting.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=157

one godhead and the true divine begetting. ”55 In this passage Eustathius 
tries to balance the claims of divine unity with those of divine distinc-
tion that the “trinitarian problem” requires. 56 He wants to assert that 
there is one godhead (thereby preserving Christian monotheism), while 
at the same time acknowledging the personal distinctions of Father and 
Son that result from a true qeogoniva. Without giving a comparable survey of Marcellus’s trinitarian the-
ology, we can make the following observations about the similarities 
and differences between his trinitarian thought and that of Eustathius. Two Early Nicenes 127 In keeping with his anti-Arian and pro-Nicene sympathies, Marcellus 
is emphatic that there is only one God.57 He states that the Word is 
Lord and God,58 that the Word is one and the same with God,59 and 
that the Word belongs to the unity or oneness of God.60 As Eustathius 
did, Marcellus asserts the existence of one uJpovstasi~ in the Christian 
godhead. 61 Marcellus coordinates this with an assertion that there is one 
provswpon in the godhead; the evidence for a comparable statement in 
Eustathius is less explicit, though it might lend itself to a similar conclu-
sion. 62 Marcellus, like Eustathius and the Nicene Creed, asserts that all 
things are made through the Word,63 whom he also calls Wisdom, as 
Eustathius does at his Fr. 72.64 Like Eustathius, Marcellus does not de-
vote attention to the Nicene oJmoouvsion, though he is scandalized by 
the notion of multiple oujsivai in the godhead, a view he attributes in the 
pre-Nicene period especially to Eusebius of Caesarea.65 On a couple of 
points we see especially close parallels between the teaching of Marcel-
lus and Eustathius. In his Frs. 76–80, Marcellus states that the Word 
has his own glory in his pre-incarnate existence, which glory is then 
granted to the man whom the Word assumed in the incarnation. 66",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=158

has his own glory in his pre-incarnate existence, which glory is then 
granted to the man whom the Word assumed in the incarnation. 66 And 
regarding the Arian prooftext Proverbs 8:22, Marcellus, like Eustathius, 
attributes the description of “creation” to the human ﬂ esh that the 
Word assumed, asserting, also like Eustathius, that “the ways” created 
for humanity by the incarnation include instructions regarding jus-
tice. 67 Lastly, Eustathius and Marcellus share anti-Origenist views. The 
entire commentary on the Witch of Endor has an anti-Origenist thrust, 
mostly against Origen’s allegorical exegesis.68 Marcellus criticizes Ori-
gen’s trinitarian theology in his Frs. 19–22.69
Comparison of the extant fragments of both thinkers reveals some 
signiﬁ cant divergences between the trinitarian theologies of the two 
bishops. On the basis of what survives, one might say that, at least 
 superﬁ cially, Marcellus is more self-consciously trinitarian than Eu-
stathius, in that he gives some attention, however obscure, to the Holy 
Spirit in addition to the Father and Son,70 and he speaks about the 
“Triad” as well as the “Dyad.”71 Marcellus also frequently uses the term 
“monad” for the Christian godhead, which does not occur in Eu-
stathius. 72 Marcellus is more explicit and emphatic about the second
128 Kelley McCarthy Spoerl
 person’s eternity than Eustathius is.73 What most notably sets Eustathius 
and Marcellus apart is their consideration of the second person’s pre-
existent generation and the titles he bears as a result. I noted earlier that 
Eustathius often uses the title “Word and God” for the second person

incarnate second person, which one might expect since he insists upon 
a “true divine birth” and the Son’s preexistent begetting, not creation. When one looks at the fragments of Marcellus, the evidence is con-
tradictory, which has generated much scholarship on these questions:

Marcellus speak of a pre-incarnate begetting of the Word/Son?74 Op-

Eustathius often uses the title “Word and God” for the second person

the “ﬁ rst” name of the pre-incarnate Christ.75 Likewise, there are frag-
ments that seem to restrict the title “Son” to the incarnate Word.76 But 
then there are also statements that the Word is “God’s true Son”77 and 
references to the Son in contexts that predate the incarnation.78 One ob-
serves the same ambiguity with Marcellus’s use of “begetting” language. Marcellus uses the vague language of “coming forth” for the emergence 
of the Word79 and in some fragments seems to reject outright the notion 
of a preexistent generation or birth of the Word.80 But he also makes 
statements such as the following: Therefore, to have said that “He was begotten before the age” 
seems to me a correct statement: that which has come forth from 
the Father who sent it forth becomes an offspring. But the [latter] 
statement was no longer correctly or piously understood by him 
[Asterius]. For to say that he who has come forth from Him is not 
the Word but simply “only Son” and that this is the true manner of 
his begetting has often given those who hear of it the impression of 
a human appearance. 81 Here we glimpse the reason for Marcellus’s ambivalence about the 
use of language about sonship and begetting for the preexistent Word:

he is afraid that it will import anthropomorphism into Christian ideas 
of deity. 82 But given the language of Scripture and liturgy in which all 
sides of the Arian controversy were invested, it is unavoidable, and so it 
is clear that Marcellus will use such language—but only if it is carefully 
qualiﬁ ed, and in his case, usually with the language of the Word and 
his “coming forth. ”83 Given that his preferred language lends itself 
much less readily to a recognition of the Word’s personal distinctive-

distinctions between Father and Son. This conjecture may receive further conﬁ rmation from the fact 
that while Marcellus and Eustathius agree that the incarnate Word is 
an image of God, they completely disagree about whether the preexis-
tent Word is an image of the divine. As noted above, Eustathius asserts 
that the Son is both image of the Father and image of the divine sub-
stance. 85 Marcellus discusses this proposition extensively in his Frs. 
51–56, arguing that an image must be corporeal and perceptible, that 
through which the invisible becomes comprehensible. 86 Later, in Frs. 
113–14, he criticizes Asterius for just the claim Eustathius makes in his 
Fr. 95, that the Word is an “unchanged image of [the Father’s] sub-
stance”: “Therefore, if he is image of [the Father’s] oujsiva, then he can 
no longer be oujsiva itself . . . . For the image is not of itself, but is [image 
of] something [else].”87 Marcellus argues here that if the preexistent 
Word is image of God, he cannot be God himself—the very “Arian” 
position he is trying to refute. The similarities between the trinitarian ideas of Eustathius and

Eustathius was clearer on the personal distinctions in the Christian 
God and less emphatically unitarian than the bishop of Ancyra.88

Eustathius’s Christological Teaching: 
Survey and Comparison with Marcellus
When Eustathius describes the incarnation, he most often speaks of 
it as involving the divine Word’s “bearing” or “assuming” a man.89 He therefore refers to the “god-bearing man.”90 He frequently uses the 
idiosyncratic expression “the man of Christ.”91 He also speaks of the 
mode of incarnation in terms of analogies with fastening,92 clothing,93 
or a mixture.94 While the man whom the Word assumes is constructed 
of many parts,95 he is still perfect (tevleio~), just as the indwelling Son of 
God is perfect. 96 Hence the assumed humanity comprises both a com-
pletely normal body capable of the normal physiological processes, es-
pecially digestion,97 and a human soul capable of the normal psycho-
logical experiences, including the emotions of fear and grief, especially 
evident in the agony in Gethsemane.98 The soul, in fact, is necessary in 
order for the experiences of the body, such as hunger and pain, to be 
perceptible. 99 But the inclusion of both body and soul in the humanity 
of Christ is also essential to Christ’s salviﬁ c mission, according to Eu-
stathius. The latter describes this generally in Fr. 99—“for the sake of 
the salvation of men, he attached a man to the Word and God”100—but 
he is more speciﬁ c elsewhere.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=162

stathius. The latter describes this generally in Fr. 99—“for the sake of 
the salvation of men, he attached a man to the Word and God”100—but 
he is more speciﬁ c elsewhere. In Fr. 50, Eustathius insists that in order 
to save the whole human being, body and soul, God the Word must as-
sume a human soul as well as a body: “Not partially healing and having 
left behind uncared for the more honorable part of this [the human 
temple], but dispensing the care of the whole, he assumed the whole of 
what belongs to us.”101 This stress on the role of the human soul in ef-
fecting salvation then becomes a key part of Eustathius’s biblical exe-
gesis, notably his claim that it was Christ’s soul that brought that of the 
repentant thief to heaven on the day of his cruciﬁ xion and entomb-
ment. 102 When making this claim about the necessity of the human soul in 
the incarnate Savior, Eustathius looks back to the past as well as to the 
present. Denial of the existence of a human soul in Christ, he says, is 
just another form of the Docetism that Marcion espoused in the second 
century; 103 Eustathius argues implicitly that denying the existence of a
Two Early Nicenes 131
human soul in Christ compromises his real humanity and thus the au-
thenticity of the incarnation just as much as the denial of a human body 
in him. But the more contemporary reference to this error applies to the 
Arians, who, Eustathius says, deny the human soul in Christ so as to 
 attribute Christ’s experiences of weakness and vulnerability to the in-
dwelling Word/Son, thus proving the latter’s mutability. 104 While ac-
knowledging that the Holy Spirit plays some role in effecting the 
incarnation105 and strengthens the man Christ,106 Eustathius does not 
think the Holy Spirit is the subject of the incarnate Christ, but rather 
that the “divine spirit” is, with which the human soul coexists. Eu-
stathius thereby seems to think of the “divine spirit” as the Word/Son—
though this is not absolutely clear. 107 Eustathius asserts that the human 
soul can coexist with the indwelling Word because it is immaculate and 
completely without sin,108 just as Christ’s human ﬂ esh was. 109 Between 
Frs. 51 and 61, Eustathius discusses whether or not human souls are 
unbegotten. 110 In Fr. 60 he points to the intellectual maturation of 
human babies as proof they are not.111",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=163

human babies as proof they are not.111 The point of this discussion is to 
refute the doctrine of transmigration, which Eustathius attributes to 
the “Ariomaniacs.”112 Although references to the incarnate Word ap-
pear in this section in Frs. 56–57, however, Eustathius does not spell out 
the implications of these anthropological observations for his Chris-
tology or his eschatology. 113
Other analogies that Eustathius uses for the assumed man include 
the temple,114 the instrument,115 the tent,116 the form or semblance,117 the 
theophany,118 and the covering or perceptible covering. 119 With the ref-
erence to the humanity of Christ as the perceptible covering, we broach 
further reﬂ ections on Christ’s status as image. Though Eustathius, 
 unlike Marcellus, is willing to grant the pre-incarnate Word/Son the 
status of image, he is in agreement with Marcellus that the “man of 
Christ” is a visible image through which we perceive divinity. 120 Eu-
stathius speciﬁ cally states in Fr. 68 that just as the Son is the image of 
the Father, the man whom he bore is the image of the Son.121 It is perhaps signiﬁ cant, in view of what follows, that in the same 
fragment Eustathius asserts that “the Son is one thing, but his image is 
another.”122 This is a similar statement to that in Fr. 91, where Eu-
stathius says, with regard to the notion that the “fullness of divinity” 132 Kelley McCarthy Spoerl
dwells in Christ, that “one thing is that which inhabits, but another is 
that which is inhabited.”123 This latter statement may be important be-
cause Eustathius says that the two things “naturally differ from one an-
other,”124 suggesting, at least indirectly, the existence of two natures in 
Christ. The Syriac fragment 81 says exactly this, but the text is uncer-
tain.125 On the other hand, in Fr. 2, Eustathius speaks of the Son’s hav-
ing assumed “human nature (ajnqrwpeivan fuvsin),”126 and statements 
like this, combined with Eustathius’s references to the Word as God 
“by nature,” also support Eustathius’s attribution of both human and 
divine natures to Christ. 127
What is unambiguous in Eustathius’s extant writings is his practice 
of what will later be called “dividing the sayings.”",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=164

divine natures to Christ. 127
What is unambiguous in Eustathius’s extant writings is his practice 
of what will later be called “dividing the sayings.” That is, Eustathius is 
careful to attribute human experiences described in the Gospels to the 
man Christ, and to attribute the divine actions to the indwelling Son/
Word. This is most evident in Frs. 97–98, where Eustathius asserts that 
“they are crazy, raving, wild, and out of their minds who presume to 
 attribute suffering to God the Word,”128 and “neither is it right to say 
that the Word and God died.”129 The same sentiment appears in Fr. 
125, where Eustathius reiterates the differences between the one in-
dwelling the man Christ and the one indwelt. 130 Granted, Fr. 119 pro-
vides counter evidence for this claim; there, Eustathius says that Christ’s 
executioners “were caught when in killing him, they nailed the divine 
Word to the cross.”131 Despite this discrepancy, it seems that the pre-
ponderance of the evidence suggests Eustathius’s lack of support for 
the communicatio idiomatum that would obviate the need to “divide the 
sayings.” Finally, in addition to suggesting that Christ incorporates two na-
tures, Eustathius also suggests in one series of Latin fragments that 
Christ incorporates two persons, one divine and one human. As we will 
see, this occurs in the context of discussing the end time, when the man 
Christ will rule as king—the very context in which Marcellus makes 
some of his most provocative christological statements. Of this time, 
Eustathius says: “‘When the Son of Man shall sit on his glorious throne’; 
indeed one person (persona) seems to speak, but manifestly makes ref-
erence to another (altera). Therefore the divine spirit clearly appears to 
be speaking about the man.”132 Granted, it is unclear what term would 
have appeared in the original Greek: uJpovstasi~ or provswpon? Given Two Early Nicenes 133
the exegetical context of the passage, I argue that provswpon is more 
likely. 133",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=165

have appeared in the original Greek: uJpovstasi~ or provswpon? Given Two Early Nicenes 133
the exegetical context of the passage, I argue that provswpon is more

what might have looked to others like a “dyoprosopic” Christology, 
which would ﬁ nd further elaboration in the theologies of later Anti-
ochene theologians such as Diodore of Tarsus, Theodore of Mopsues-
tia, and Nestorius of Constantinople. The fact that the passage does not 
survive in the original language should make us cautious. Yet com-
bined with Eustathius’s practice of “dividing the sayings” and his as-
sertion that the indwelling Word and assumed man are two distinct 
things, this conclusion seems defensible. On this point, namely, the claim that there are two things incorpo-
rated in Christ, intriguing parallels between Eustathius and Marcellus 
appear. Before turning to them, we should note some basic similarities 
and differences between the Christologies of the two bishops. Like Eu-
stathius, Marcellus describes the incarnation as the assumption of a 
man.134 He speaks of the incarnation as involving the union of the man 
with the Word135 or the joining of the man to the Word.136 In keeping 
with his exegesis of Proverbs 8:22, which he shares with Eustathius, 
Marcellus states that the man is created in himself (the Word) and 
thereby is the “ﬁ rstborn of all creation.”137 On the other hand, Marcel-
lus equally and even more frequently speaks of the incarnation as the 
assumption or taking of the ﬂ esh,138 as being born in the ﬂ esh,139 as 
union with ﬂ esh,140 or as the assumption of a body.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=166

Marcellus also speaks of the economy according to the ﬂ esh,142 though 
in one instance he will link this to “the man,” as in Fr. 72, where he says, 
“we know to refer the economy according to the ﬂ esh to the man. . . .”143 
In one instance, Marcellus speaks of the incarnation as involving the 
addition of the ﬂ esh to the Savior (hJ kata; savrka prosqhvkh), which gives 
the impression of diversity in the single godhead or monad, whereas “if 
one were only to consider the spirit, the Word would naturally appear 
 to be one and the same with God.”144 Given that Eustathius also iden-
tiﬁ es the divine element in the incarnate Word as “the divine spirit,” 
this is a point of agreement between Marcellus and Eustathius, though 
Eustathius is eager to stress the fellowship between the divine spirit 
and the human soul in Christ; Marcellus does not discuss the  latter ex-
plicitly. 134 Kelley McCarthy Spoerl As noted above, whether he speaks of it as the man or as the ﬂ esh, 
Marcellus, with Eustathius, insists that the humanity of Christ is the 
image of the invisible God: “it is clear from the start that before the as-
sumption of our body, the Word in and of Himself was not ‘image of 
the invisible God’ (Col 1:14). For it is ﬁ tting for the image to be seen, so 
that through the image what has hitherto been invisible might be 
seen.”145 The latter statement, with its revealing reference to the incar-
nation as the assumption of our body (tou' hJmetevrou swvmato~), leads us 
to some observations about Marcellus’s view of the purpose of the 
 incarnation. Marcellus attributes numerous beneﬁ ts to humankind re-
sulting from the incarnation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=167

sulting from the incarnation. Through the incarnation, the ﬂ esh ac-
quires healing through communion with the Word,146 the race of the 
god-fearing is called into adoption,147 the Devil is conquered,148 and 
man acquires kingship and status as Lord and God,149 as well as glory150 
and immortality. 151 Distinctive about Marcellus’s exposition of these 
beneﬁ ts is that when he says they accrue to humankind through the as-
sumption of the man, the “man” often has not only an individual refer-
ence to the humanity of Christ, but also a corporate reference to all 
humans descending from Adam. 152 Fr. 80 illustrates this best: And he deemed the man who fell through disobedience worthy 
to be joined through the Virgin to his own Word. For what other 
sort of glory among men could be greater than this glory? Having 
said, “I have gloriﬁ ed you,” [the Father] continues, saying “And I 
will glorify [you] again,” (John 12:28) so that because of his abun-
dant lovingkindness in the second glory after the resurrection of 
the ﬂ esh, he might make immortal the man who was previously 
mortal . . . .153 The reference to the Johannine text makes clear the blurring be-
tween the individual humanity of Christ and the generic humanity of 
the redeemed. Another fragment indicates that such blurring could 
give the impression of adoptionism. In Fr. 111, Marcellus states: “And 
because of this, [he] does not call himself Son of God, but everywhere 
he says that he is Son of Man, so that through such a confession, he 
might enable the man to become Son of God by adoption (qevsei)154

here is how the pointed use of the titles “Son of God” and “Son of Man” 
in Fr. 111 could suggest a “dyoprosopic” Christology in the thought of 
Marcellus, wherein Christ is comprised of the divine provswpon (which 
need not presume the hypostatic independence of the Word) fused to 
the human provswpon of the man Jesus. As noted earlier, Marcellus does 
not endorse an independent provswpon or uJpovstasi~ for the Word 
apart from the Father. But the idea that the humanity of Christ could 
incorporate a uJpovstasi~ distinct from that of the undifferentiated god-
head appears in Fr. 85, where Marcellus suggests that Asterius argues 
for a second hypostasis of the Word on the basis of the human ﬂ esh that 
the Word of God assumed. 156 While the terminology that the two bishops 
use is different, I argue that Marcellus and Eustathius both attribute a 
distinctiveness to the humanity of Christ, whether on the level of 
uJpovstasi~ or provswpon, that might well give rise to accusations of 
teaching “two sons.” Compounding this impression in Marcellus is his suggestion that 
the humanity of the incarnate Christ is separable from the divinity, and 
may well become so in the ﬁ nal times. This claim occurs in those frag-
ments that preserve Marcellus’s exegesis of 1 Corinthians 15, where he 
speculates about what will happen to the incarnate Word after the con-
clusion of salvation history. 157 On the basis of the Pauline text, Marcel-
lus argues that once the man Christ has subjected all things to himself, 
he in turn will be subjected to the Father and return as Word into the 
godhead. This will entail the end of Christ’s kingship as man,158 which 
kingship only existed after the incarnation of the Word,159 and which 
began “not four hundred whole years ago. ”",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=169

is ﬁ tting for the human economy to be united with the Word.”161 What 
will happen to the humanity of Christ after the end of this appointed 
time, Marcellus is loath to specify in the absence of a clear teaching of 
Scripture. 162 Nevertheless, that this humanity will be separated from 
the Word is clear, and Marcellus justiﬁ es this on the basis of John 
6:61–63, where Christ asserts, “It is the Spirit that gives life; the ﬂ esh is 
of no avail. ”163
136 Kelley McCarthy Spoerl These fragments ﬁ nd an echo in a series of fragments from Eu-
stathius’s work Contra Arianos,164 in which he also speaks about the fu-
ture time when the “Son of Man” will sit upon his glorious throne. Eustathius discusses here Matthew 19:28, not 1 Corinthians 15, but he, 
as noted earlier, uses this biblical passage to suggest that there are two 
different personae in Christ. 165 His exegesis attributes the throne more 
speciﬁ cally to the “man of Christ” whom the Word assumes, than cor-
porately to redeemed humanity, as in Marcellus. 166 However, one should 
note in the same work, shortly after this series of fragments, the cryptic 
statement: “Everything that has a beginning will also have an end. Ev-
erything having an end is capable of being destroyed.”167 In view of 
Marcellus’s claim in a similar context that the incarnation will have an 
end, and Eustathius’s insistence that the human soul is not unbegotten 
and therefore at least theoretically subject to destruction,168 this remark 
is intriguing, to say the least. Of course, one would have to have a lot 
more context to interpret it fully. One last point of comparison between Eustathius and Marcellus 
concerns Marcellus’s exegesis of the Agony in the Garden from the Pas-
sion accounts of the Synoptic Gospels. 169 We should remember that 
 Eustathius discusses this event explicitly to assert the presence of a mu-
table human soul in Christ as the subject of the fear the Savior endured 
on this occasion.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=170

table human soul in Christ as the subject of the fear the Savior endured 
on this occasion. 170 Marcellus discusses this to counter Asterius’s claim 
that Christ said “I and the Father are one” (John 10:30) because of “their 
agreement in all things”—in other words, Asterius’s positing of two 
 uJpostavsei~ of Father and Son bonded via a moral unity. In order to re-
fute this claim, Marcellus points to Christ’s request in Gethsemane to 
“let this cup pass” (Matt 26:39), which, he argues, refutes the notion of 
moral unity between the incarnate Word and the Father. 171 Marcellus 
says nothing speciﬁ c in this regard, but it would be natural to assume 
on the basis of the statement that he assumes in the incarnate Christ a 
human psychology capable of experiencing fear and aversion at the 
prospect of impending cruciﬁ xion, and a rational deliberative capacity 
capable of choosing to cooperate with the Passion despite these nega-
tive emotions. In short, one might well conclude that Marcellus as-
sumes a human soul in the incarnate Word, though he never explicitly 
says so.172
Two Early Nicenes 137
Conclusion The careers of Eustathius of Antioch and Marcellus of Ancyra were 
linked in the pre- and post-Nicene period. Both bishops were opposed 
to Arius, both supported the decisions of Nicea, and both eventually 
ran afoul of Eusebius of Caesarea. A comparison of their respective the-
ologies reveals afﬁ nities: on the Trinity, both stress the single godhead 
shared by Father and Son and possibly the Nicene claim of a single di-
vine uJpovstasi~;173 both assert Christ’s preexistent glory; both offer a 
comparable exegesis of Proverbs 8:22. But it also reveals notable differ-
ences: for example, the status of the preexistent Christ as an image of 
God. Thus, the early opposition ranged against Arius at Nicea and af-
terward was not uniform; its members sought to assert forcefully the 
divine unity between Father and Son but diverged in how this unity 
was coordinated with the distinction of the persons. Eustathius’s theol-
ogy appears somewhat more accommodating to the latter task than that 
of Marcellus.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=171

of Marcellus. But that such divergence existed early on in the Nicene 
camp might have prepared the way for later attempts from within the 
Nicene party to balance the Nicene account of divine unity with a 
meaningful account of divine distinction, as occurred in the 350s, when 
Athanasius incorporated anti-Marcellan rhetoric in his pro-Nicene ar-
gumentation. 174
Overall, I argue that there is greater similarity between the Chris-
tologies of Eustathius and Marcellus than between their trinitarian the-
ologies. Both present an incarnate Word whose humanity is the subject 
of real physiological and psychological processes and whose distinction 
from the Savior’s indwelling divinity is stressed. This is signiﬁ cant be-
cause it potentially illuminates another inﬂ uence on the Christology of 
Apollinarius of Laodicea. My research indicates that the anti-Marcellan 
literary tradition initiated by Eusebius of Caesarea inﬂ uenced not only 
Apollinarius’s trinitarian theology but also his Christology.175 The kin-
ship between the Christologies of Marcellus and Eustathius and their 
shared Nicene convictions make it possible that, in the course of his 
anti-Marcellan researches, Apollinarius, himself a supporter of Nicea, 
also became acquainted with the work of Marcellus’s one-time ally

 Eustathius, who explicitly articulated the christological assertion that 
Apollinarius would one day vigorously challenge: the idea that Christ 
had a human soul. More work is necessary to substantiate such a claim. What is clear for now is that Declerck’s monumental achievement has 
greatly facilitated the exploration of the thought of another key ﬁ gure 
in the early Arian controversy. Such exploration may lend further sup-
port to the contention that this controversy provided the initial matrix 
for the evolution of Apollinarian thought. Notes 1. Eustathii Antiocheni, Patris Nicaeni, Opera Quae Supersunt Omnia, ed.

godhead” is perfect, having been begotten from the most perfect Father. He 
goes on to say that this perfect Son of God would not prepare an imperfect tem-
ple for himself (i.e., a human body without a soul). I argue that in these passages 
we see a clear contrast between the preexistent Son of God and the incarnate 
Christ, which assumes Eustathius’s comfort with ascribing the title “Son” to the 
preexistent Word. This may also be correlated with Eustathius calling the Fa-

Eustathius, there are no references to the category of provswpon in trinitarian

in the context of scriptural exegesis, as in several places in the De Engast.; or in 
christological contexts, where Eustathius refers to the provswpon of Christ, as in 
Fr. 100.165.1–6, where Eustathius talks of one persona speaking about another, 
the divine spirit speaking about the human Christ. 63. Marcellus, Fr. 16.16.7–9; Fr. 87.74.12–13; Fr. 98.88.12–13. 64. Marcellus, Fr. 88.76.11–15. Cf. Eustathius, Fr. 72.144.7–8; cf. also Fr.

for Marcellus. 85. Eustathius, Fr. 68.139.3–5; Fr. 95.162.1–2. 86. Marcellus, Frs. 51–56 (Vinzent, 46.1–50.6). 87. Marcellus, Frs. 113–14 (Vinzent, 106.2–108.5), especially 114 (Vinzent,

would also nuance Lewis Ayres’s brief comparison of Eustathius and Marcellus 
in Nicaea and Its Legacy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), 68–69. I ques-
tion Ayres’s assertion that Eustathius does not follow the Alexandrian/Athana-
sian pattern of using genetic metaphors to express the generation of the Word or 
Son. I think the evidence suggests just the opposite—that Eustathius is comfort-
able with using these metaphors, or at least more comfortable than Marcellus is. 89. Eustathius, Fr. 21.84.14 (ejfovrese); cf. also Fr. 22.85.2; Fr. 67.139.1; to

where Eustathius speaks of the “incorporeal spirit of Wisdom,” using another 
christological title in a context in which the relationship between the Father and 
Son and the Son’s status as image of the latter is discussed. In general, Eustathius 
speaks of the divine spirit as the divine element in Christ: cf., for example, Fr. 
7.68.12–15; Fr. 10.70.1–71.5; Fr. 17.79.6–8; Fr. 19.81.23–25; Fr. 20.83.30–36; Fr.

the divine spirit); Fr. 49.121.1–2; Fr. 76.147.1–5; Fr. 77.147.3–148.5. It is confus-
ing that in Fr. 78.148.6–8, Eustathius speaks of the incorporeal Wisdom along-
side the undeﬁ led substance (oujsiva) in opposition to the corporeal “temple” 
(Christ’s humanity) in the incarnation, suggesting that the divine spirit is di-
vinity without personal distinctiveness. But in Fr. 100.165.1–6, Eustathius speaks 
of the divine spirit as the divine persona that speaks to the man Jesus, the human 
persona—thus suggesting that spirit could be hypostasized as Son—as opposed 
to the Father. In addition, Eustathius is absolutely clear in Fr. 2.65.18–24, Fr. 
3.65.1–9, and Fr. 85.154.1–5 that it is the “child (pai'~) of God,” the gnhvsio~ uiJov~, 
and the one anointed (oJ crisqei;~), as opposed to the Father himself, who be-
comes incarnate. Again, what we may see in this is a clear distinction in Eu-
stathius’s thinking between Father and Son—without the terminology to ex-
press it precisely. 108. Fr. 50.122.20–23. 109. Fr. 43.117.31–33. 110. Frs. 51–61 (Declerck, 123.1–130.9). 111. Fr. 60.129.1–2. 112. Eustathius condemns this doctrine explicitly as nonsense in Fr. 54 and

tion of fragments labeled “spuria et dubia.” 173. Again, the fact that Eustathius’s statement of this in Fr. 88 survives

Loving Christ according to 
Origen and Augustine
Basil Studer, O.S.B.
W
hen I was ﬁ rst invited to contribute to Brian Daley’s Festschrift, 
I was asked to provide an overview of recent trends in the litera-
ture on the soteriology of early Christian authors.1 While such an over-
view would certainly prove useful, it unfortunately lies beyond the 
more modest ambitions that I have set forth for this essay. I will, rather, 
limit myself to two theologians, Origen of Alexandria and Augustine 
of Hippo, both of whom, to this day, continue to receive remarkable 
scholarly attention. I think I am justiﬁ ed in selecting these two authors 
if only for the simple reason that, in the last few years, reference works 
devoted to each of these theologians have appeared. The Dizionario 
Origene2 was published a few years ago in Italian, and more recently, 
the Westminster Handbook to Origen3 has been offered to an English 
 audience. For Augustine, in addition to the fascicles of the Augustinus-
Lexikon4 that continue to emerge, there is also the encyclopedia, Augus-
tine through the Ages.5",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=186

150 Basil Studer, O.S.B. The topic of Origen and Augustine’s soteriologies requires, never-
theless, further restriction. If a presentation of patristic soteriology will 
resonate with us today, then it ought to articulate, I would contend, the 
personal dimension of this topic. As such, I would like to present Ori-
gen’s and Augustine’s views on loving Christ as integral to their respec-
tive soteriologies. It is clear that both theologians have a profound 
interest in the Johannine theme of God’s love that preceded our love 
(1 John 4:8–10). But we can only speak of God’s preceding love for us in 
its fullest sense when we also include our response, that is, our own love 
for God and, consequently, our love for Christ. The topic for this essay, 
then, is our love for Christ. At the “Ninth Origen Conference” I delivered a paper on Origen’s 
view of loving Christ,7 and in my recent introduction to Augustine’s 
De Trinitate I devoted the last chapter to Augustine’s view of loving 
Christ.8 In this essay the task remains to summarize and compare the 
results of both of these previous studies. Even if I cannot scale the 
heights that the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, reached 
in his paper on Augustine’s Christology at the 2003 International Pa-
tristics Conference in Oxford,9 I nevertheless attempt to offer in my 
analysis of Origen and Augustine what believers today especially wish 
to discover: an account of salvation that accentuates the love, and in-
deed the friendship, that exists between believers and Christ. Loving Christ in Origen
 “Christ is present to all who seek him.” —Origen, Hom. Lev. 9.14
The Theological Discipline—a Quest for the Truth

and of tracing the extent to which his exegesis inﬂ uenced the thinkers,

and of tracing the extent to which his exegesis inﬂ uenced the thinkers, 
preachers, and theologians of subsequent generations. 10 It used to be 
that Origen’s De principiis stood at the foreground of research, and with
Loving Christ according to Origen and Augustine 151
that, a strong interest in its philosophical orientation11 (one indication of 
which is the remarkable energy expended in deciphering the title Peri 
archon). 12
De principiis was one of Origen’s earliest writings, and even if we 
keep its fourth book in mind, in which Origen discusses at length Scrip-
ture and its interpretation, it is clear that De principiis does not yet re-
ﬂ ect the robust sort of scriptural interpretation that we see elsewhere in 
his writings, in which he opens up to believers the deeper senses of 
Holy Scripture. Furthermore, many of his reﬂ ections in this work are 
admittedly of a philosophical nature (if one even wants to distinguish 
between philosophy and theology in this period), and it is certainly also 
the case that Origen seldom addresses Christ in this work as his “Lord 
and Master,” as he will do in his sermons. Nevertheless, De principiis is 
a thoroughly theological project, as Origen himself announces at the 
beginning of the work (though the opening lines of this work are very 
often overlooked). 13 “All who believe and are convinced that grace and 
truth came by Jesus Christ,” Origen begins, “derive the knowledge 
which calls men to lead a good and blessed life from no other source 
but the very words and teaching of Christ.”14 But since many who pro-
fess to believe in Christ interpret these words differently, it is impera-
tive that these words receive an ecclesiastical interpretation, namely, an 
interpretation in accordance with the regula ﬁ dei.15 Decisive in this in-
troduction, however, is that it opens with faith in Christ, who is the 
“Way, the Truth and the Life” (John 14:6). Perhaps the author of De principiis speaks even more clearly about 
the intent of this work at the end of the second book.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=188

of book 2, entitled “De repromissionibus” (Concerning the Promises), 
Origen offers a clear account of theological inquiry. 16 In this passage 
Origen describes the search for truth as an inquiry that includes the 
presence of Christ. He opens the chapter by referring to the person who 
directs omnem industriam to studies, “in order that he can, by inquiry 
into truth, learn the causes and reason of things.”17 A little later in this 
chapter he also describes “theology” more precisely as a “natural and 
appropriate longing to know God’s truth and to learn the causes of 
things. ”18 Origen asks, then, if this sort of theological inquiry will also 
exist in that life that is the true life, that life that is hidden with Christ

“love of truth” (cf. 2 Thess 2:10) that God has implanted in our minds, 
Origen suggests that we need to realize the ordo vivendi on two levels,

comes evident. 19 In this earthly life, the Christian draws out the sketch 
of a portrait whose details will only be ﬁ lled out in the eternal life. This 
shadowy sketch is only of value, however, if it is written on the “tablets

the meaning of all things that transpire on earth—the meaning of man, 
of the Holy Spirit’s grace to believers, the history of Israel, creation, and 
divine providence. 21 In heaven, in paradise, in the locus eruditionis, in 
the auditorium, and in the schola animarum, believers will be taught by 
Christ about everything that they saw on earth.22 Even more, they will 
ascend through the heavenly spheres and learn even about these as well. To the extent that they follow Jesus who has walked through the heav-
ens, they will attain, each according to his measure, to the vision of 
God.23 For Origen, theology is therefore a search for truth, and both in 
this life as well as in the life to come, Christ is the teacher of this truth. Christ, the Revelation of God
Two points must be kept in mind if we want to grasp the sense of this 
remarkable program. The ﬁ rst is that we have to be clear about the 
comprehensive signiﬁ cance of Origen’s claim that Christ is the “Truth.” This is a claim that he, in fact, likes to make, as in the prologue to De 
principiis where, immediately after exhorting readers to remember the 
words of the Lord, he writes: “I am the Truth (John 14:6).”24 In connec-
tion with other Johannine and Pauline texts, Origen readily maintains 
that “to remain in Christ” means the same as to “remain in the Truth.”25

When Origen repeatedly and emphatically describes Christ as the 
“Truth,” he wants to express that Christ reveals God as his and our Fa-
ther.26 This contention is repeatedly supported in Origen’s writings 
with a reference to Matthew 11:27: “No one knows the Son except the 
Father and no one knows the Father, except the Son and he to whom 
the Son will reveal it.”27 Origen draws upon the concept of “Truth” to 
help explain these words of Jesus. For the ﬁ rst part of this verse, he 
notes that only the Father knows the Son, that is, the Truth, since 
the Father himself is the Truth. 28 But Origen will also and more cus-
tomarily highlight the fact that the Son, precisely because he is also the 
Truth, knows the Father and therefore is also capable of revealing 
him. 29 As “Truth,” Christ allows us traverse from the “beginnings of 
the law to the perfection of the gospel.”30 Nevertheless, Origen does not 
exclude the fact that the Truth was already among us prior to the ad-
vent of the Redeemer.31 
What Origen contends about the “Truth,” that it reveals the Fa-
ther, pertains to the “Truth” that is mentioned in the opening lines of 
the prologue of De principiis. This is readily clear when we keep in 
mind that the ﬁ rst two books of the Commentary on John, in which Ori-
gen explores at length the revelatory action of the Logos, were written 
prior to De principiis.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=191

Origen’s theological corpus (not only in his exegetical writings, but also 
in Contra Celsum and De principiis) where he speaks of “Truth” together 
with the other customary “aspects” (ejpivnoiai) of the Son—Wisdom, 
Logos, Life, and Justice.32 What is particularly signiﬁ cant about these 
aspects is that Origen can connect “Truth” with “Wisdom” and “Word,” 
a connection that makes especially clear that he has the Son as God’s 
revelation in mind.33 This is especially evident in a passage from De 
principiis where Origen is wrestling with the claim at the beginning of 
the Letter to the Hebrews that Christ is the “express image” of God’s 
substance (Heb 1:3): See, then, whether the Son of God, who is called God’s “Word” 
and “Wisdom,” and who alone knows the Father and reveals him 
to whom he will, to those, namely, who become capable of receiv-
ing his Word and Wisdom, may not perhaps be said to express the

makes God understood and known; that is, when Wisdom out-
lines ﬁ rst in herself the things which she wishes to reveal to others, 
by means of which they are to know and understand God, then she 
herself may be called the “express image of God’s substance” 
(Heb 1:3).34 The extent to which, for Origen, the knowledge of God is rooted 
in belief in Jesus Christ is perhaps most clearly expressed in his inter-
pretation of Moses’ vision in Exodus 33:21ff.35",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=192

turns to this passage, even in De principiis, where, in a discussion of 
the invisibility of God, he explains how Moses and Christ (John 14:9) 
have “seen” God.36 In another discussion of Exodus 33 in the Commen-
tary on the Song of Songs, Origen wrestles with the meaning of the fora-
men petrae (cleft in the rock) and posteriora (back).37 What does it mean 
that God put Moses in the “cleft of the rock” and, after God has passed 
by, Moses was allowed to see God’s “back”? According to Origen, the 
ﬁ rst phrase means that in the rock, namely, Christ, there is a cleft 
which is open to God. The “back” of God, on the other hand, is what 
can only be seen at the end of time by that person who stands in the ﬁ s-
sure of the rock, i.e. who has learnt from the revelation of Christ.38 It is

In order to grasp fully the signiﬁ cance of Origen’s claim that “Christ is 
the Truth” we must not only observe how Christ serves as God’s reve-
lation, but also—and this is the second point—we must discern that 
Origen strikes a personal note with this claim.39 When he considers 
Christ the magister eruditionis on earth and in heaven, he means the 
“Truth” which looks at him and addresses him. This is already evident 
in those texts in which Origen speaks of Christ opening to the believing 
Christian the sense of Scripture.40 Along these lines, Origen also thinks 
of the voice of the preacher as the voice of Christ. The apostle Paul, 
moreover, gives him the certainty that Christ speaks in us.41 Origen is at
Loving Christ according to Origen and Augustine 155
his clearest in those countless passages where he takes up the Pauline 
theme of Christ removing the obstructing veil from those who listen to 
him (cf. 2 Cor 3:12–18).42 We also discern this personal dimension in those texts in which 
Origen speaks of the place, house, or dwelling where Christ is found by 
those who search for him. 43 We detect in such passages that someone 
can also serve as the Lord’s companion, indeed, even be counted as his 
friend. 44 If someone praises Jesus, Origen preaches, and receives him, 
this person’s strength increases. 45 This intimacy with Christ takes on 
heightened import in those passages where Origen presents Christ as 
the doctor of souls. 46 Moreover, Origen stresses the signiﬁ cance of the 
human soul of Jesus,47 which is for him priest and mediator.48 Precisely 
in this context, Christ as “Truth” signiﬁ es Christ as our Lord and 
 Master. Whoever attends to this personal dimension that colors Origen’s 
discussions of Christ as “Truth” will not be surprised to learn that he 
repeatedly interrupts his discussion of difﬁ cult questions, especially 
those that arise from his labors with the Scriptures, with prayers.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=194

quest that the Lord might disclose to him and his hearers the sense of 
the passage that has been read in church. 49 Noticeable also is how Ori-
gen presents Joshua in the Homilies on Joshua and Homilies on Judges as 
the prototype of Jesus.50 Thus it is hardly surprising that precisely in 
these homilies Origen turns in prayer to Christ. Take the following 
passage that alludes to the foot-washing scene in John’s Gospel:
Come, I pray, Lord Jesus, Son of God, take off your outer garment 
and pour water into the basin and wash the feet of your servants. Wash the feet of our souls, so that we can say: “I have washed my 
feet, so how can I dirty them again?” And when you wash our feet, 
we would like to remain by you and listen to you, since you are our 
Lord and Master.”51
From his Homilies on Jeremiah comes the invitation to his hearers: “We 
want to pray that Jesus comes, that he reveals himself and teaches us the 
meaning of the passage that has been read.”52 A little later he adds: “I
156 Basil Studer, O.S.B.
need an appearance [ejpifavneia] of the power of Jesus, since he is Wis-
dom, Word and Truth, so that his arrival might illumine my face.”53 An 
indication of just how personal Origen understands these prayers to 
be is the remarkable way in which he uses “my Jesus” as a form of 
 address. 54 On this personal level, Origen holds to the conviction that a be-
liever ought to love Christ who is the Truth.55 While he does not say this 
expressly, the idea is nevertheless present in his writings. For example, 
loving Christ is implied when Origen exhorts us to search for Jesus, 
that is, the Logos, the Wisdom, the Righteousness, the Truth, and the 
Righteousness of God—all those aspects that characterize Christ—and 
in so doing, search for the Father as well. 56",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=195

ing Christ is implied is when Origen invites believers, like the people of 
Nazareth, to look up to Jesus,57 to become his followers and become one 
in spirit with him. 58 Sometimes this love for Christ is explicitly stated, 
as when Origen exhorts his congregation to love Christ the Lord “in in-
corruption” (Eph 6:24), that is, to love Christ with an uncorrupted un-
derstanding or to offer an uncorrupted body to God.59 Yet perhaps 
Origen is at his clearest when he offers his interpretation of Psalm 36:23 
and its mention of the “steps” that are taken (gressus).60 These steps sig-
nify for him the soul’s continual ascent. This is an ascent, in turn, that 
strives for higher knowledge, and so in this context Origen takes over 
the request of Moses for the vision of God, though he especially speaks 
of striving for Christ, who is the Power of God. Upon what path should 
the soul take its steps to Christ? The answer, Origen says, is that the 
inner man must stride on a particular path, the Path, or Way, that says: 
“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life” (John 14:6).61 Origen describes 
this Way upon which the inner man walks as a via media and concludes: 
“Whoever allows himself to be lead by God, strives for Christ and longs 
to remain in him.”62

ought also to be seen as integral to the theological project of De prin-

Christ, the Truth
Augustine’s readers know how prominent the concept of “truth” is for 
him. The search for the truth governed Augustine’s entire existence, 
and the initial impulse in this direction can be traced back to his discov-
ery of the disciplina philosophica during his studies in Carthage. Particu-
larly decisive was his reading of Cicero’s Hortensius (a text no longer 
extant). 66 This work awoke in him the desire to strive for that bliss that 
could be found in the “enjoyment of truth.”67 Taking his cues from Ar-
istotle, the famous Roman rhetorician invited the reader to philosophy, 
to the love of truth. Augustine made Cicero’s ideal his own—even the 
rhetorician ought to be a lover of truth.68
For Augustine, the path to “truth” is marked by philosophy even 
more so than was the case with Origen. Yet from the very beginning, 
Augustine too places “truth” in a Christian context. He understands 
philosophical “truth” in the light of the Christian piety that he has re-
ceived from his mother:69 for him, Christ is the “Truth.”70",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=197

philosophical “truth” in the light of the Christian piety that he has re-
ceived from his mother:69 for him, Christ is the “Truth.”70 The extent to 
which Augustine is indebted to the biblical understanding of “Truth” 
already appears in the fact that he continually refers to biblical, indeed, 
Johannine passages where veritas appears. He frequently refers to the 
saying of Jesus: “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life” (John 14:6).71
158 Basil Studer, O.S.B. He can even make use of the formula Veritas dicit, when citing Jesus.72 
Of even greater signiﬁ cance are the references to John 8:31ff.,73 John 
1:14 and 1:17,74 and 2 Timothy 2:25. In texts where Augustine speaks of veritas, something divine is usu-
ally meant—God, or expressed more philosophically, the veritas im-
mutabilis.75 In christological contexts, Augustine means by veritas the 
divinity of Christ. He distinguishes this divinity from the via, the hu-
manity of Christ, which leads to his divinity, his Truth, his Life.76 In 
De Trinitate Augustine avails himself of Pauline categories, linking 
 veritas with the forma dei and via with the forma servi.77 As is the case with Origen, Augustine also speaks of the many 
names of Jesus.78 While he certainly has a preference for verbum and 
 sapientia, he can also call Christ veritas (and probably does so more fre-
quently than Origen). The personal meaning of veritas for Augustine is 
expressed above all in the trinitarian theme: aeternitas, veritas, caritas. This is clearly articulated in the following text: But many who boast in the cross of Christ and do not depart from 
the same path, even those who do not know those things that are 
discussed with great subtlety, because not a single infant perishes 
for whom he has died, come to the same Eternity, Truth, and Love, 
that is, to solid, certain, and complete happiness, where everything 
is clear for those who remain, see, and love. 79 In this text Augustine distinguishes the three persons not by their 
proper names, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but with the nouns aeterni-
tas, veritas, and caritas.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=198

proper names, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but with the nouns aeterni-
tas, veritas, and caritas. Veritas gives us the certainty that we can attain, 
with the help of caritas, to felicitas, and that felicitas is, in turn, rooted in 
aeternitas.80 This trinitarian interpretation of veritas is also implied in 
those passages where Augustine, quoting Scripture, opens with “veritas 
dicit” or “dixit.”81 
Our Path Is Marked by Faith in Christ
Truth and Faith
Whoever wishes to explore more deeply what Augustine meant when 
he called Christ “Truth” must examine more closely the relationship
Loving Christ according to Origen and Augustine 159
between veritas and ﬁ des. It is not important to know if he is talking 
about veritas ﬁ dei or the veritas of the Bible. Decisive here is how Au-
gustine understands the role of Christ in the life of faith. In his writings, and especially in his sermons, Augustine repeatedly 
describes the Christian life with verbs ire, ambulare, navigari, peregri-
nari, and se extendere transire. 82 With these images he means to depict 
nothing other than faith in Christ. With this faith we advance on the 
path that is Christ and arrive at Truth, which is Christ himself. The 
theme of Christian pilgrimage occupies Augustine’s thoughts in his 
 exposition on Psalm 123:
Let us therefore so walk as if we were on the way, for the king of 
our country himself has made himself the way. The king of our 
country, the Lord Jesus Christ—there He is the Truth, but here He 
is the Way. Where are we going? To the Truth. By what path are 
we going? By faith. Where are we going? To Christ. By what path 
are we going? By Christ.83 This faith that serves as a signpost for the Christian journey encom-
passes the entire trinitarian dispensatio salutis as it is summarized in the 
confession of faith. 84 The source of this faith in the Son of God is, in 
fact, Christ. When someone approaches the Truth in faith, the divine 
Truth has already established in its incarnation this person’s faith, so 
that this person’s way to God has become possible through the incar-
nation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=199

Truth has already established in its incarnation this person’s faith, so 
that this person’s way to God has become possible through the incar-
nation. In order for the person conﬁ dently to traverse the path of faith 
to Truth, the Truth itself, God, God’s Son, has taken up a man while 
preserving his divinity, and in that act has ﬁ rmly established faith. In 
this way can the person reach God through the God-man. Christ, the 
mediator, is for this person not only the journey’s end but also the way 
itself. 85 
Augustine goes even further in his exhortations to faith in Christ. It is clear for him that Christians ought also to deepen their faith by un-
derstanding it more profoundly. This intellectus ﬁ dei is based at its core 
on the presence of Christ. Christ helps believers attain a more compre-
hensive understanding of what the loving God wants. In this sense Au-
gustine is clear: “Christus loquitur de Christo.”86 Even more, Augustine 
never tires of speaking of Christ as his sole teacher.87 As magister exterior
160 Basil Studer, O.S.B.
Christ exhorts to faith; as magister interior Christ allows Christians to 
realize that this faith is really true.88 Christ teaches through the Spirit 
whom he promised and through this Spirit’s Love.89
Christ Rules through Faith This conception of Christ as both the Way and the Truth clearly has its 
roots in Scripture, and above all, in the fourth Gospel. There is, how-
ever, another theme that Augustine develops that is equally rooted in 
Scripture. His encounter with the western Arians compelled him to 
 examine in greater depth 1 Corinthians 15:24–28, where Paul spoke of 
the subjection of the Son to the Father at the end of time. Augustine 
 already offered an interpretation of this passage in his early writing, 
De diversis quaestionibus LXXXIII.90 In the ﬁ rst book of De Trinitate he 
returns to this Pauline text.91 He begins by refuting a series of interpretations of this Pauline pas-
sage.92 First, the words of the apostle are not to be understood in the 
sense of a future transformation of Christ’s humanity into divinity, 
since this divinity is not a mutable creature but rather the incorporeal 
and unchanging Trinity. 93 Furthermore, it is also the case that Paul did 
not mean by the subjection of the Son to the Father the future transfor-
mation of the creature into the substance of the creator.94",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=200

this passage certainly does not say that while the Father has, in fact, 
subjected all things to himself, the Son has not subjected all things to 
himself. Furthermore, Christ will not hand over the kingdom to God 
his Father in such a way that he, Christ, himself takes it, since he is with 
the Father one God.95 Finally, one also cannot interpret the handing 
over of the kingdom in such a way that the Father does not have the 
kingdom right now.96 After this lengthy critique of various misread-
ings, Augustine presents his own interpretation. Christ is now the king 
of all those who are just, who live by faith. As mediator between God 
and man, the man Christ Jesus leads men to the unveiled vision of God. “The sentence: ‘when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father,’ 
means the same as: he leads believers to the vision of the Father.”97 Au-
gustine conﬁ rms that interpretation with other passages of Scripture, 
including Matthew 11:47, where the power that the Father has given to 
the Son is interpreted by Augustine as the revelation of the Father
Loving Christ according to Origen and Augustine 161
through the Son.98 With such an interpretation Augustine repeats his 
main contention: Christ hands the kingdom over to the Father “when 
he, the mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, leads 
those whom he now as king rules, those who are just and who live by 
faith, to the vision of God the Father.”99
Faith Becomes Truth In his exegesis of 1 Corinthians 15:24–28, Augustine does not describe 
explicitly as truth the vision of Christ in which believers will also see the 
Father unveiled. He does so, however, in a more philosophical passage 
in De Trinitate.100 With an allusion to Plato— “As eternity is to that 
which has originated, so truth is to faith”101—Augustine develops his 
own conception of the puriﬁ cation of the human spirit that is required 
for the vision of God.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=201

own conception of the puriﬁ cation of the human spirit that is required 
for the vision of God. We were incapable of comprehending eternal re-
alities, he begins, because we were weighed down by our sins and mor-
tality, and so we required puriﬁ cation. But we could only be puriﬁ ed 
for eternal realities by temporal realities, the useful ones that heal us 
and lead us, once we have recovered, to eternal things. Thus, the ratio-
nal mind, once puriﬁ ed (mens purgata), is designed to contemplate eter-
nal realities, but while it is still requiring puriﬁ cation (mens purganda), 
must give faith to temporal realities. 102 And what sort of purifying tem-
poral realities ought we to believe? Here Augustine turns to the incar-
nation of Truth itself—the Son of God became Son of man, so that by 
faith in him we might be lead back to his Truth. 103 Expressed otherwise, 
Truth incarnate, as both eternal and temporal, serves as the bridge for 
us: being puriﬁ ed by our faith in his temporal life, of all he did for us, 
our faith turns to truth and our mortality turns to eternity. Our faith will then become truth, when we come to what we are 
promised as believers; but what we are promised is eternal life, and 
the Truth said—not the truth our faith will become in the future, 
but the Truth which is always Truth because it is eternity—the 
Truth said: “This is eternal life, that they should know you the 
one true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent” (Jn 17:3). Therefore when our faith becomes truth by seeing, our mortality 
will be transformed into a ﬁ xed and ﬁ rm eternity. 104
162 Basil Studer, O.S.B.
Augustine expands upon this understanding of a faith that becomes 
truth by paraphrasing another one of his favorite Johannine texts:

will know the Truth and it will set you free” (John 8:31ff.).",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=202

words of Jesus Augustine justiﬁ es his main thesis: “So because what has 
originated in him [Christ] has passed over into eternity, so too will what 
has originated in us pass over when faith arrives at truth.”105
The Love for Eternal Truth
Christ is the way to Truth, is indeed the Truth himself. How central 
this basic conviction is for Augustine’s theology becomes clear from his 
frequent citations of the words of Isaiah: “If you do not believe, you will 
not understand” (Isa 7:9b).106 The faith that leads to truth forms above 
all the leitmotif of the ﬁ fteen books of De Trinitate. To grasp this point 
it is helpful to attend to the eighth book of this work, in which Augus-
tine goes from the res verae (books 1–7) to the similia veri (books 9–15).107 In the eighth book Augustine asks himself the important question: If 
we do not know the Trinity, can we really love it? 108 In the books that 
follow, Augustine ascends through the various analogies for the exter-
nal and internal human up to the imago sapientiae, in order to attempt 
to understand approximately what the “Trinitas quae est unus Deus” is. The result of his inquiry is that such a knowledge is only possible here 
in this life in hope, in love, in the “stretching out to what lies ahead. ”109 
Put in other words, love takes place in the knowledge of the faith, in the 
credendo diligere. 110 The love that emerges from the knowledge of the faith is rooted in 
a love for Jesus, and in particular, a love of his resurrection.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=203

Put in other words, love takes place in the knowledge of the faith, in the 
credendo diligere. 110 The love that emerges from the knowledge of the faith is rooted in 
a love for Jesus, and in particular, a love of his resurrection. In the sec-
ond book of De Trinitate, Augustine develops this cardinal tenet of his 
trinitarian theology by referring to the theophany on Mt. Sinai.111 There 
Moses requests God to show him his majesty, and God’s response is that 
no mortal can see his “face” and live, but that he will let Moses stand on 
a “rock” and see his “back.”112 This verse compels Augustine to relay an 
interpretation of this passage customary in his day. The theophany pre-
ﬁ gures the person of Jesus Christ, and so the “back” of Jesus is his ﬂ esh 
that was born from Mary, died, and was resurrected. 113 The “face,” on
Loving Christ according to Origen and Augustine 163
the other hand, which no man can see and live, is described by Augus-
tine as the immortal, divine nature of Christ, that is, the forma in which 
Christ is equal to the Father.114 A few lines later he describes this “face” 
as the “open manifestation” of God’s Wisdom. While no mortal can see 
this face, nevertheless, “this is the sight which everyone yearns to be-
hold” who both loves God and loves his neighbor. 115 
But while “we are away from the Lord and walking by faith and 
not by sight” (2 Cor 5:6), we have to behold Christ’s back, that is his 
ﬂ esh, by this same faith; standing that is upon the solid foundation 
of faith, which is represented by the rock, and gazing at his ﬂ esh 
from the security of the lookout on the rock, namely the Catholic 
church,116 of which it is said, “And upon this rock I will build my 
church” (Mt 16:18). All the surer is our love for the face of Christ 
which we long to see, the more clearly we recognize in his back 
how much Christ ﬁ rst loved us. 117
With this emphasis upon our faith in the “back,” the ﬂ esh of Christ, 
as integral to our love for him, it is hardly surprising that Augustine 
immediately turns to the resurrection of this ﬂ esh. What is its sig-
niﬁ cance for the believer?",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=204

as integral to our love for him, it is hardly surprising that Augustine 
immediately turns to the resurrection of this ﬂ esh. What is its sig-
niﬁ cance for the believer? Augustine answers that it is a loving faith in 
this ﬂ esh’s resurrection that saves and justiﬁ es. This belief is what gives 
value to the Christian faith, and, what is more, believers also await in 
the certainty of hope for the resurrection of their own bodies. 118 So cen-
tral is this faith in the resurrection that Augustine discusses at some 
length how many Jews came to believe in the Lord after his resurrec-
tion. 119 Augustine sums up his discussion of this theophany by noting 
that the “face” is the “supreme and supremely divine and changeless 
substance in which the one and only God is both Father and Son and 
Holy Spirit.”120 Thus, to the extent that Augustine connects the desire 
for the vision of this divine face with the faith in the resurrection of 
Christ, he basically pronounces that our love for the Trinity corresponds 
to our loving faith in the resurrection of Christ.121 In the love for the resurrected Lord, the Christian thus encounters 
the blessed vision of the “Trinitas quae est unus Deus.” This conviction 
that marks Augustine’s entire theological thought, in particular, his
164 Basil Studer, O.S.B.

that marks Augustine’s entire theological thought, in particular, his

 inquiry into the unity of the Father, Son, and Spirit, ﬁ nds a double con-
ﬁ rmation in his writings. 122 First, in his ascending search for the trini-

image according to which he was created, the image of the resurrected 
Lord. 125 Only when this person comes to resemble the gloriﬁ ed Jesus 
can he become the perfect image of the “Trinitas quae est unus Deus.”126 And second, anyone who is familiar with Augustine’s writings and, in 
particular, attends to the openings of some of his letters must notice 
how often he speaks of the dilectio Christi.127 It is possible that these 
two words had become formulaic by Augustine’s day. Nevertheless, 
 behind this expression there is the ﬁ rm conviction that the Christian 
ought to respond in love to the love Jesus embodied, that God ﬁ rst 
loved us. Concluding Thoughts
Throughout both Origen’s and Augustine’s writings, Christ appears as 
“the Truth.” For both authors it then follows that salvation consists in a 
sort of knowledge. Without doubt both authors can express in other 
ways the perfection or renewal of spiritual creation that has been cre-
ated according to the image of God.128 Nevertheless, the interest in 
inner illumination predominates. This cannot come as a surprise when 
one takes into consideration that both authors were primarily in di-
alogue with intellectuals, and that they both labored to promote the 
knowledge of the faith in simple Christians. Their conception of salva-
tion can be described, thus, as a Christian Gnosis or as a revelation of 
divine love. The intellectual orientation of their theological thinking 
seems, correspondingly, philosophical. But when one pays attention to 
how closely both Origen and Augustine follow the Johannine writings, 
one cannot avoid the fact that their love for the “Truth” is deeply in-
formed by Holy Scripture. Whenever they refer to the words of Jesus,
Loving Christ according to Origen and Augustine 165
“I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,” and other similar expressions 
of the Lord, they clearly indicate how much they are at home in the bib-
lical world. They call Jesus Christ “the Son of God,” and for this reason 
the “Truth of God” or simply the “Truth,” because he reveals the Fa-
ther and “explains” what he has always seen (cf. John 1:18).",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=206

ther and “explains” what he has always seen (cf. John 1:18). In his incar-
nation he has become the way that leads to “Truth,” to the vision of his 
countenance against which the glory of God illumines. Moreover, both 
theologians leave no doubt that this “Truth” ought to be understood in 
a completely personal manner. Christ is the “Truth” when he looks 
people in the eyes and talks with them. He is the “Truth” that believers 
come to know in greater depth the more they strive for it and love it as 
it appears in Jesus, the incarnate Truth. There are certainly noticeable differences between the ways in 
which Origen and Augustine speak of Christ as the Truth. Turning 
aside from the reﬂ ections of the bishop of Hippo about the knowledge 
of truth that ring more philosophical, the framework in which both 
theologians thinks about the Trinity is different. In Origen’s pre-Nicene 
epoch, the distance between the Trinity and creation is less clearly ex-
pressed than in the Nicene theology of Augustine, in which the eternal 
identity and therefore the oneness of the three persons stand. Origen, 
for his part, devotes more thought to the soul of Jesus than does Augus-
tine, whereas Augustine comes closer to the later conception of the per-
sonal unity of Christ. The bishop of Hippo puts more weight on the 
renewal of the sinner through grace than does the master from Alexan-
dria, who accentuates the role of human freedom in this renewal. These 
and other differences in the framework of the soteriological thought of 
these two theologians do not, however, call into question the funda-
mental agreement between them. For both, Christ serves as the medi-
ator between God and man, the way that leads to Truth. For both, the 
human quest for the vision of God remains unfulﬁ lled without a faith-
ful love for Christ. And it is precisely here that their conceptions of ﬁ nal 
salvation correspond to the expectations of people today who long for 
personal dialogue and loving exchange.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=207

“Truth” with respect to the Father but as “Image” with respect to us. With re-
spect to the Father, Christ resembles the Father whose Ideas he himself contains. With respect to us, Christ is an Image that opens our eyes for the Father. Nor-
mally, however, Origen calls the Son the “Truth” since he instructs people of his 
Father. (Cf. Origen, Princ. I 2,6: Görgemanns, Origenes, 136. In addition, SC

the Father through all his aspects (ejpivnoiai)—not just the “Truth” but also 
“Word,” “Life,” “Wisdom,” and so on guide us to the Father (cf. Comm. Jo. I 
16,92: SC 120,108). 30. Origen, Hom. Jer. 12,13: SC 238,46. 31. Origen, Princ. IV 2,3: Görgemanns, Origenes, 706. In addition, n. 26–26a:

ticular biblical passage that Origen is, at any given time, commenting upon. For 
instance, in his Commentary on Romans Origen often connects “Truth” with 
“Righteousness” (Origen, Comm. Rom. I,16: Fontes Christiani 2/1, 134–42. In

the eyes, but rather a ﬁ gurative sight, the seeing of the mind. In this context he 
cites Matt 11:27, “No one knows the Son except the Father,” and reminds read-

prayer to God through Christ who is the Truth). In his De Oratione and espe-
cially in his Dialogue with Heraclides Origen gives a clear account of the one to 
whom Christians ought to address their prayers (cf. esp. Origen, Dial. 4: SC 
67,62ff. Also cf. E. von Severus, “Gebet” I, V.b, in Reallexikkon für Antike und 
Christentum 8 [1972]: 1235ff.; Orat. 15,1–4; GCS Origenes, II/2, 333–36, and Cels. 
V,4: SC 147,20ff.). In the Dialogue Origen makes the remarkable claim that 
prayer is not made twice, but rather once to God through God (Dial. 4: SC 
67,62). The extent to which prayer to Christ and the Father belong together is 
also clear from Origen’s request that believers pray with him to both Christ and 
to his Father (cum Patre suo) (cf. Origen, Hom. Ezech. XII,5: SC 352,396). At any 
rate, his insistence on the liturgical prayer directed to God is not in conﬂ ict with 
the personal prayer directed toward Christ. After all, as is already the case in Ju-
daism, Christian prayer also consists in calling upon the name of God. It is ori-
ented to the Father who is our God (cf. the openings of the apostolic letters in 
the New Testament). Not less personal are the prayers directed to Christ, espe-
cially those that come from the Acts of the Martyrs and can already be seen in 
the “Acts of the Apostles” (cf. J. Lebreton, Histoire du dogme de la Trinitè, vol. 2

more common usage of the noun. He opposes to veritas, mendacium and “error” 
(cf. Augustine, Trin. II prol. 1: CCSL 50,80; Trin. XIII 19,24: CCSL 50A,426, 
with Rom 1:18, and Trin. IV 3,6: CCSL 50,167, with Eph 4:25). He uses the word 
in the sense of “reality,” i.e., of true existence (cf. the contrast between ﬁ gura and

speaks also of the historical truth (cf. Augustine, Trin. XII 12,19: CCSL 50,373) 
or of true teaching (Augustine, Trin. III prol. 2: CCSL 50,128, with catholica ﬁ des

indicates supreme conformity with the Father. The true Word is, as he says in 
another text of De Trinitate, like the Father in all respects, the perfectly coherent
Loving Christ according to Origen and Augustine 173
expression of the Father who pronounces it (cf. Augustine, Trin. XV 11,20:

quod homo, per hoc et via.” Augustine develops the idea of an incarnation that 
leads to truth in a similar manner when referring to John 1:14 and 1:17. In this 
idea, gratia relates to the incarnation while veritas refers to the eternal life. Cf.

Augustine’s Christology 177
it is possible to see in Augustine a notably coherent christological 
scheme. The deﬁ nitive studies of T. van Bavel and, more recently, of 
H. R. Drobner have established some of the important shifts in Augus-
tine’s christological vocabulary; Drobner, in particular, has also made 
plain the roots of so much of that vocabulary in the conventions of rhe-
torical analysis.2 Among the questions raised by this is why Augustine’s 
Christology ﬁ ts so comfortably with the theology of Cyril of Alexandria 
in its resonant afﬁ rmations of the unity of the incarnate Word, when 
those in the Eastern Christian world who employed comparable meth-
ods from rhetoric ended up with a much more dualist reading of 
Christ’s person. I want to suggest that when we have grasped with Le 
Blond the logic of seeing Christ as the form of the spiritual path, with 
all that this involves, we may understand why the “Cyrilline” structure 
imposes itself. Brieﬂ y, my argument is simply that the unifying principle of Au-
gustine’s mature Christology is the understanding of Christ as sapientia. Wisdom, as deﬁ ned in De doctrina christiana (Doctr. chr.), in Trin., and 
elsewhere, is the contemplation of the eternal, God’s delight in God; as 
such, it is what we hope to receive by grace, so that we acquire a share 
in that reﬂ exive contemplative love which is God’s very life. But that 
divine love as bestowing itself on creation is (as may be seen from a 
close reading of the later books of Trin.) identical with that divine ac-
tion which seeks the “justice” of another’s good or joy, and is therefore 
bound up with the divine identiﬁ cation with us in the incarnation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=223

pienta is oriented to incarnation, and thus to the rhetorical paradoxes 
which involve the divine Word speaking not only human words, but 
also words of spiritual distress or apparent doubt—the constant theme 
of so many of the Enarrationes in Psalmos (Enarrat. Ps.). And the upshot 
in practical terms is, as Le Blond asserts, that “incarnation” becomes the 
path we must follow, la soumission de l’espirit aux symbols temporels.3 The embrace of our creatureliness, and resistance to all that draws us 
away from the recognition of the centrality of time in our learning of 
holiness—these are the actual consequences of the act of incarnation, 
making sense of both the individual path of sanctity and the Church’s 
corporate life and discipline. 178 Rowan Douglas Williams
Some Illustrative Texts These themes are announced very straightforwardly in Confessions 
(Conf.) book 7, where Augustine offers an already very nuanced ac-
count of what it is to become wise with the sapienta of the divine Word, 
a wisdom which is not available through the speculations of the Pla-
tonists;4 this world’s “wisdom” is overtaken by the humility of the in-
carnation. While the wisdom of the world seeks truth by escape from 
the body, by techniques designed to free us from the distortions im-
posed by ﬂ eshly life, God’s wisdom takes root in us only as we accept 
our bodily limitation and our spiritual frailty as things we cannot cure 
from within. Wisdom must become milk for infants if it is to enter our 
minds; it must be encountered in the ﬂ esh. The incarnation both re-
quires and makes possible the conditions of its understanding: “non 
enim tenebam Dominum meum Iesum humilis humilem.”5",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=224

humbles us so that we may accept the way of humility as the way to 
truth; only prosternere allows us to rise to the heights of God’s wisdom. God’s love brings the eternal Word into the human world, and that 
same love allows us to face our creatureliness and our sin in honesty, 
knowing that God’s will is for our good. In so doing, we reﬂ ect God’s 
caritas and know God’s light, the lux supra mentem which is accessible 
only to love.6 The displacement of our desire to rise by our own strength 
delivers us from the idolatry of the self which impedes love. Absent this 
process—as in the Platonic books—and growth becomes impossible. When I know that I am presently imperfect, I know I must grow in 
order to feed more fully on Christ who is the Truth (cresce et mandu-
cabis); and nothing can be built except on the foundation of humility 
which is Christ.7
Here, as in Doctr. chr., the underlying point is that the abandon-
ment required for us to receive the true knowledge of God is not, so to 
speak, the “spatial” abandonment of the world of material things in 
order to rise to a higher realm, but the abandonment of attachment to 
the projects and desires of the unregenerate will. The refusal to identify 
God with any res in the world, the recognition of creation itself as sig-
num, with the cross of Christ as the central proof of this, is another

construction of desire into hope for God, the exspectatio which Le Blond 
sees as the climax of the argument of the Confessions. By the incarna-
tion, God both binds us to the temporal world as always and inescap-
ably our starting point and dispossesses us of the illusion that there is a 
point within that temporal world where we can settle. Every point in 
the temporal order becomes a point of departure, to borrow a phrase 
from Michel de Certeau. The leaving behind of our limited material 
condition is a temporal and not a spatial matter, in that it involves the 
journey of growth and learning in time. The peregrinatio, which is the 
basic form of discipleship, is the willingness to see every present mo-
ment as the place which a desire for God obliges me to leave, yet also as 
the necessary prompt or stimulus to the journey of desire, not as some-
thing simply to be negated. This is Platonism still, we may well say, but 
given a distinctive turn by the intensiﬁ cation of the particular prompt-
ings of history, focused on the cruciﬁ ed Christ. To imitate the humility of the incarnate Christ is to come to occupy 
his position vis-à-vis God, so that his humility is indeed the doorway to 
knowledge of the eternal. This is the force of the language about divine

of Augustine’s most extended treatments of the person and work of 
Christ, this is spelled out very explicitly. We are unﬁ t for the contem-
plation of God because of our sin. Wicked and proud as we are, we can 
be made capable of participating in the divine Word, being illuminated, 
only by means of sanguis iusti et humilitas dei. God stoops to become a 
righteous human being so that, as human but not sinful, he may inter-
cede for us so that, created though we are, we may still contemplate 
God. God is what we are not by nature; but by the Word’s participation 
in humanity, we may share the Word’s divinity in being enlightened 
with his light (and thus, by implication, sharing his contemplative rela-
tion to the Father). In an image which Augustine goes on to develop at 
length, the incarnate Word “adds” to our humanity in congruentia or

human identity in which mortal body and damnable soul are united 
with the single purpose of divine love so that they are made capable of 
seeing God and being resurrected. Of this resurrection, Christ’s own is 
given in sacramento et exemplo.8 The incarnation here is seen as the act of divine self-offering which,

in book 4 elaborating the mathematical appropriateness of adding a 
 simplum to a duplum; but the theological heart of the argument is in ef-
fect an anticipation of the scholastic notion that the humanity of Christ 
is distinct not because of an extra element alongside the human soul 
and body (as if the incarnate Word were part of a threefold complex of 
equipollent elements) but because the soul-body compound is in this 
case concretely animated and individuated by a single divine agency. That is a more involved issue than can be discussed here, but, as we 
shall see later, it illuminates the most distinctive feature of Augustine’s 
deployment of rhetorical idiom in this context. It also relates to the theme opened up a little later in Trin. book 4 
and very prominent in Augustine’s preaching. In Trin. 4.9.12 Augus-
tine reﬂ ects upon the prayer of Jesus in John 17, that the disciples will 
become one as the Father and the Son are one. Jesus, says Augustine, 
does not simply speak of a unity of nature (unum) between himself and 
his disciples, although the Church may say that it is unus with Christ, 
one subject, in the sense that there is one head of the Body and one 
Body. The focus is on the total unity between Son and Father, which is 
to be reﬂ ected among the disciples: this is to be not merely the natural 
unity between members of the human species but a harmonious will, a 
tending toward one and the same blissful heavenly end. The unum of 
the Father and the Son is a unity of substance and will; so for the Church 
the unity prayed for is dilectionis societas. This societas is attainable only 
in Christ, who binds us together in such a way that we are no longer

comes an image of the single focus of the trinitarian life upon its own 
intrinsic joy; as we are corporately directed toward this bliss, we share 
in God’s self-relatedness. Here the major themes of the closing books of 
De Trinitate are already sketched, but they are related very directly to 
the understanding of the Body of Christ as the form of our renewed 
life under grace. But one of the most interesting aspects of this passage is the refer-
ence to the sense in which the Church and Christ are unus. The argu-
ment of the passage is thereby connected to the theology of Christ as 
Head of the Body which pervades the Enarrationes in Psalmos, where it 
is used precisely as a tool of rhetorical criticism. Who speaks in the 
Psalms? Christ as Head; and as Head, he makes his own words that 
would otherwise shock or puzzle, words of guilt or suffering. Just as his 
death (as we are told at Trin. 4.2.4) is meritoriously effective because it 
is voluntarily endured, not received as punishment, so the entire range 
of what we might call death-directed experience in humanity is volun-
tarily embraced by the incarnate Word. Augustine’s de agone offers a 
classical exposition of the aproslepton atherapeuton argument (i.e., “that 
which is not assumed is not healed”), and much of the Enarrationes can 
be read as an elaboration of this. In an utterance like “My God, my 
God, why have you forsaken me?” (Matt 27:46; Mark 15:35; Ps 22:1), 
we can identify the speaker not simply as a guilty and suffering human 
subject, but as the one who freely undertakes to make all human guilt 
and suffering his own. By incarnation, death, and resurrection, the 
Word creates a relation between himself and the human race that brings 
all human experience within the scope of healing and restoration.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=229

Word animates the particular soul and body that is Jesus, and in so em-
bracing this human nature becomes the animating principle of any and 
every human identity associated with him by baptismal incorporation 
and the gift of the Spirit. The speaker in the Psalms is the Christ who 
tells Saul in Acts 9:4 that he is persecuting him (the Acts text is referred 
to fourteen times in the Enarrat. Ps. as a hermeneutical principle).9 
Enarrat. Ps. 88.30 adds a further dimension, connecting the Head and 
Body theme with the earlier one of divine humility: “[Christ’s] love did 
not allow the Head to separate himself from union with the Body” even

in the exalted state following the Ascension. Thus there is no context in 
which Christ speaks simply as human or simply as God; he speaks as 
the one who by taking on humanity through his divine will and power 
has become Head of the Body, speaking uniquely as representative of 
humanity in virtue of his divinity. The “right” of the exalted Christ to 
speak for humanity rests upon the divine decision to take ﬂ esh—and 
not only to take the speciﬁ c ﬂ esh of Jesus of Nazareth but to create by 
that ﬂ esh the historical Body that is the company of believers, so that 
their variegated and ﬂ awed human experience may be offered by the 
eternal Word and touched with his transforming presence. It is possible, then, to say, as does Augustine in Enarrat. Ps. 21, that 
Christ speaks in our persona. The expression personam sustinere is used 
here, as in other places, to mean something like representing, acting in 
the role of someone. It is more or less the same in sense as another of 
Augustine’s locutions, agere personam, and both are used by him in the 
works of the 390s to express aspects of the incarnation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=230

cution that does not have to do with Christology, but that also suggests 
a deeper level of signiﬁ cance, we may turn to Trin. 12.12.18: Adam and 
Eve both deserve punishment for sin, as each personam suam portabat. The fact, though, that Adam and Eve also represent different dimen-
sions of human subjectivity and decision making should not lead us 
astray into thinking that somehow different bits of our selfhood are 
judged independently (as Eve would have been judged even if Adam 
had not sinned). Each of us is una persona . . . unus homo considered as 
an agent, a subject of desire, thought, and projection; each of us is 
judged as a single agent. The persona here is the terminus of responsi-
bility, what ﬁ nally speaks for or answers for our thoughts and desires, 
for the way we are. Persona operates on the frontier between legal, rhe-
torical, and what we should call psychological reference. But we need to be alert to the complexities of this. The Word of 
God may be said to speak or act in our persona in virtue of his assump-
tion of humanity (and there are of course several issues about how that 
“assumption” is best characterized, to say nothing of the varied vocabu-
lary for it). Agere hominem appears in several early works (De ordine and 
Div. quaest. LXXXIII) as a way of describing the Word’s action. But 
this does not mean that the persona of fallen humanity, the homo acti-
Augustine’s Christology 183
vated by the Word and for which he speaks, is some kind of inde-
pendent subject associated with the Word of God. The Word’s ability 
to sustain this persona is, as we have seen, grounded in the Word’s eter-
nal act and determination, the act that assumes or includes humanity in 
its life. Hence, prior to anything that can be said about the Word speak-

Son is a speaking or acting in the person of divine Wisdom: agere per-

and more strongly in the 390s and early 400s is that the incarnate Word 
constitutes a unitas personae in taking human nature. Trin. 4.20.30 
speaks of the homo who is joined or even “mixed” with the Word so as 
to form such a unitas, and there are very many examples of this deﬁ ni-
tion of the incarnate persona as being the Word in union with the soul 
and the body (which latter two normally constitute a persona of them-
selves). It becomes clear that Augustine’s persona is a ﬂ exible, or, better, an 
analogically complex term. Its basic meaning is fairly plain: identifying 
a persona is identifying who is speaking, whose role is in question in a 
complex of interchanges, verbal and otherwise. On that basis, persona 
questions about Christ can be answered at several different levels. The 
words of straightforward human suffering or fear in the Gospels are 
spoken in the persona of a fully vulnerable member of the human race; 
the words that must be attributed to Christ as the Word speaking in 
Scripture, especially in the Psalms, are spoken in the persona of what we 
might call the human condition in general, the condition of sinful 
people cut off from God. But the entire phenomenon that is the Word 
incarnate invariably speaks for the persona of divine Wisdom, since it is 
the action of divine Wisdom that creates the divine-human grammati-
cal subject we hear speaking in Christ. Agere hominem in this sense de-
pends upon agere sapientiam, since the utterance of human grief or pain 
is the result of Christ’s being freely engaged, as Wisdom’s embodiment, 
in the world of historical suffering and struggle.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=232

Wisdom is the foundational identity with which we have to do; it is 
present and active in the form of the concrete historical persona that is 
a soul and body united with the divine Word; and as that historical 
 persona incorporates human experience beyond its own individual

 limits, by setting up the relation of Head and Body in the reality of 
the Church, the person of divine Wisdom is free to take the role of lost 
 humanity, agere hominem in the widest sense. To engage with Augustine’s use of persona, then, is to encounter a 
concept providing a ﬂ uid and many-faceted connection between exege-
sis, soteriology, and Christology in the stricter sense. We may say that 
the answer to “Who is speaking?” where Christ is concerned is always 
sapientia; yet this does not entail a divine speaker who can be identiﬁ ed 
alongside a human one. Sapientia is indeed and ultimately the contem-
plation of God by God, but it is also that which prompts and makes 
possible the presence of God in what is not God, in the order of creation 
and in the human mind. Van Bavel rightly observes that from the ﬁ rst, 
Augustine sees the incarnation as the revelation of divine reason so that 
our human reason may be awakened; but as his understanding of sapi-
entia develops, rather more than reason comes to be involved. Wisdom 
is identical with caritas, and so it is oriented always to the other’s good. The persona of Wisdom cannot therefore be isolated from its action as 
caritas; to say that Christ constantly acts in Wisdom’s person is not to as-
sert that he always speaks or acts as divine Word simpliciter, as though 
the humanity were both separate and insigniﬁ cant.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=233

dom-in-action, Wisdom engaging with what is not by nature God (cf. 
Trin. 4.2.4 again) so as to incorporate it into the divine life and make it 
capable of seeing what Wisdom sees, knowing what it knows, contem-
plating the absolute otherness of the creator as if it were located where 
eternal Wisdom is located, in the heart of the divine self- knowledge 
and self-love. Hence the truth of Le Blond’s observation with which this essay 
began: Augustine’s Christology is about spiritual method. In the ﬁ rst 
instance, it is the “method” of God’s own life, the method of sapientia. In contemplating the divine life with joy and delight, Wisdom realizes 
itself as love, the radically disinterested love that seeks the fruition of 
others in the same joy it knows; all that Augustine wrote about creation 
itself and in Doctr. chr. about the character of divine and created love 
must be understood in the background here. The humility of identiﬁ -
cation with the created other is the ﬁ tting expression of this, and the 
 ﬁ tting means by which created life may become capable of divine con-

with God and each other. 11

who (as Drobner demonstrates) have what are in some ways com-
parable concerns. The familiar debate in the Eastern christological 
 controversy over whether the sayings of the incarnate Word could 
be divided according to whether they are spoken by the Word or the 
human individual Jesus is circumvented by Augustine—not because he 
has a straightforwardly “Cyrilline” account of union kath’ hupostasin 
(this is not Augustine’s mental world), but because of a more carefully 
integrated sense of the absolute dependence of the human speech of the 
incarnate one upon the single act of divine Wisdom. The stress in Trin. 
book 4 on the simplum that is the Word’s presence and activity is signiﬁ -
cant. As we have seen, it brings to the duplum of unredeemed humanity 
not simply a third element to contribute to a sum total, but an integrat-
ing unity which transforms both parts of humanity. The phraseology of 
Trin. 4.3.6 is instructive: here Augustine speaks of how the single death 
and single resurrection of Christ serve to overcome the twofold death 
to which we are condemned. The simplum of the Word’s agency is the 
principle through which our natural elements are transformed, not a 
sort of extra subject. Consequently, the typical Antiochene anxiety about distributing 
the dicta of Jesus cannot really arise. What substantiates or gives active 
presence to this particular duplum of soul and body is the action of the 
Word, without which no human word can be spoken by this indi-
vidual, Jesus of Nazareth. He exists because the Word has elected to be
186 Rowan Douglas Williams
 incarnate, and thus what he says is said because of the eternal Word. The Word is therefore never “alongside” the human speaker. It is neatly 
put in Trin. 13.18.23: in the saints, God “reigned,” regebat, while in 
Christ he “acted,” gerebat—a very characteristic Augustinian word-
chime.12",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=235

not a divine act engaging with the act of another subject. There is, one 
could say, no “drama,” no dialogue of resistance and engagement and 
submission, between Jesus and the Word, as between the Word and 
other human beings. That is reserved for the relation between the  single 
reality of the Word incarnate and God the Father. Here the natural and 
eternal self-surrender of the Son is enacted in the circumstances of 
weak ﬂ esh, both displaying and creating the possibility of obedience to 
the Father in all circumstances; human pride is overturned by divine 
humility. 13 The divine act of humility in the incarnation itself, as por-
trayed in Conf. book 7, becomes the unifying theme of the human life 
of Jesus. And utterances of the incarnate Word which sound inappro-
priate to God are thus shown to be entirely ﬁ tting to divinity since they 
are the product of that loving sapientia which is the wellspring of the in-
carnation. So Augustine avoids the pitfalls of Antiochene exegesis on this 
question by refusing to consider the human voice of Jesus in abstraction 
from the divine self-determination which is the coming of the Word in 
the ﬂ esh. How exactly he comes to this position is far from clear, but I 
suspect that we should read it as very closely connected with his devel-
oping concern with exegesis in the 390s, and the resultant nuancing of 
his understanding of sapientia. Increasingly, the pattern of Christ as 
“reason” incarnate opens out, as the “unreasonable” in Scripture has to 
be systematically interpreted. There has to be a theological way of mak-
ing sense of the claim that God speaks in the oddities and contingen-
cies, the fragmented and not always edifying words of the Christian 
Bible; and in Doctr. chr. and Conf. a twofold hermeneutical strategy is 
developed, which has the consequences for Christology that we have

us beyond itself, requiring change and growth, the acceptance of de-
ferred desire (including deferred comprehension); and the embrace of

God’s work in the incarnation are clearly inseparable in the major 
works of the 390s; our humble acceptance of God’s accommodation to 
our condition correlates with the understanding of divine humility as 
the unifying foundation for all God’s revealing work. To paraphrase 
Conf. book 7 once again, if we cannot see that God takes our ﬂ eshly and 
temporal condition seriously enough to use it as his medium for com-
municating, we shall not take it seriously; and vice versa. Trin. book 4 
echoes both Conf. 7 and considerable tracts of Civ. in deﬁ ning the es-
sence of religious error as the attempt to achieve reconciliation with 
God by means of strategies, whether ritual or meditative, to engineer a 
way out of the human condition; in Trin. 4.12.15, the three magi are 
presented as models of those who abandoned magic and human wis-
dom to adore humilitatem domini and learned to return to their patria 
“by another way,” the way of humility taught by Christ. With a curious 
passing allusion to the imagery of the Phaedrus, by this time a trope in 
philosophical writing, Augustine warns against supposing that the 
wings of virtue can be nourished by ritual and magic; instead we are 
weighed down more than ever by our efforts to rise. So Augustine’s concern with humility develops during the 390s to-
ward the mature polemic in Trin. and Civ. against pagan theurgy as 
well as pagan speculative metaphysics; and the incarnation has a focal 
place in this argument. But there is a further dimension, harder to trace

with absence and dispossession in its human exercise (Doctr. chr. is sig-
niﬁ cant in this), so when it is applied to God, its divine exercise becomes 
more and more linked with caritas and justitia. To enact the person of 
Wisdom is inevitably bound more closely with the fundamental act of 
self-humiliation or self-dispossession in the Word’s becoming ﬂ esh. So 
to represent Wisdom is precisely to represent an agency that is displaced 
for the sake of another. The dual idiom of the Word made ﬂ esh, the 
agere of homo and sapientia inseparably, makes complete sense as a reso-
lution of the exegetical issue. 188 Rowan Douglas Williams It would be tempting but misleading to say that Augustine pro-
vides a rhetorical version of what is for the Cyrilline tradition a more 
obviously metaphysical schema for understanding Christology. Cyril-
line theology is not simply the attempt to isolate and deﬁ ne an under-
girding “something” in Jesus that can be described as divine; it is, no 
less than Augustine’s language, concerned with ﬁ nding what agency it 
is that gives unity to the components of Jesus’s humanity, and display-
ing that unity as the act of the second person of the Trinity. Equally, 
Augustine is not in any sense replacing an account of metaphysical sub-
sistents with a “functional” union between the Word and human in-
dividual (as if this were a transcription of the stale debate in New 
Testament criticism two generations ago about whether the New Tes-

of being a subject is deeply involved with reﬂ ection on language— 
representation, relation of word and external reality, memory as self-
presence, verbal images as both prompting and expressing the complex 
re-routings of desire—it is not surprising that his theology of the in-
carnation should be, in effect, an account of how God speaks within the 
nexus of human relations, and that human salvation or transﬁ guration 
should be linked so often with the idea of the Word’s speech taking up 
and taking over the varieties of confused or rebellious human speech, 
anchoring the tumultuous instability of what we feel and express in 
a solid and unbroken self-communication, the Word’s self-giving to 
the Father. Most signiﬁ cantly of all, though, and most challengingly,

Body of Christ which exists because of the sacriﬁ ce of Christ. 12. Cf. Ep. 187. 13. E.g., Trin. 4.10.13.

a style of careful investigation and charitable engagement that is an 
ever-important lesson for those of us prone to polemic. Ad multos 
annos! For some years Brian has been working on a history of patristic 
Christology that does not treat the ﬁ rst few centuries primarily as “the 
road to Chalcedon,” that is, a history which avoids focusing on how 
often inchoate accounts of Christ’s constitution anticipate or deviate 
from the terminology of that later “deﬁ nition.” It is far more fruitful, 
Brian suggests, to consider how different authors talk of Christ as an 
integral part of describing the nature of God, revelation, salvation, and 
the church. To do so is to recognize that Christology is (for patristic au-
thors, at least) also soteriology, sacramental theology, and hermeneu-
tics. In this essay I offer a contribution to this project by considering one 
of the most important texts in which Augustine discusses the personal 
constitution of Christ. Introduction and Context
Augustine’s Letter 137 has received persistent scholarly attention be-
cause it marks a new precision in Augustine’s christological terminol-
ogy.3 Here for the ﬁ rst time Augustine uses persona to name the 
metaphysical reality of Christ as a uniﬁ ed agent: he speaks of Christ 
“uniting both natures in the unity of his person.”4 At the heart of the 
letter Augustine also offers an analogy between the union of two na-
tures in Christ and the union of soul and body in the human being. 5 I 
approach this frequently discussed text via two theses. The ﬁ rst is that 
throughout the letter Augustine attempts to encourage in his address-
ees a particular practice of thought and contemplation as the appropri-
ate context for considering the constitution of Christ’s person. This 
practice is shaped by an account of how the creation exists “within” 
God’s presence and displays the mystery of God’s ordering and gov-
erning power.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=241

ate context for considering the constitution of Christ’s person. This 
practice is shaped by an account of how the creation exists “within” 
God’s presence and displays the mystery of God’s ordering and gov-
erning power. At the same time, Augustine argues that such attention 
must exhibit the epistemological humility modeled by the incarnate 
Christ. My second thesis is that, against this background, Augustine 
offers the soul/body analogy not in order to make the union of na-
tures more  comprehensible, but to allow him to deﬁ ne and reﬂ ect on
192 Lewis Ayres
the incomprehensibility of the union of natures in Christ. The genius of 
Augustine’s argument is to offer a conceptual context within which the 
incomprehensibility of the union may both be seen as plausible and be 
deﬁ ned with some precision. In order to understand the style of Augustine’s focus on intellectual 
practices, it is important to note that Letter 137 is part of an exchange 
with some of North Africa’s most inﬂ uential ﬁ gures. At some point be-
fore late 411, Volusianus, the addressee of the letter, was the proconsul 
of Africa.6 Volusianus had written to Augustine reporting a number of 
questions about the doctrine of the incarnation that emerged during 
what appears to have been a regular philosophical discussion among 
Volusianus and his friends, all of whom appear to be non-Christians. Volusianus addresses Augustine as the all-knowing bishop and ex- 
rhetorician who should, for the sake of his own reputation, answer 
the questions he reports.7 The document preserved as Letter 136 in Au-

sophical practice—thus making a claim on cultural capital Volusianus 
imagines to be his own—and yet one that ﬁ nds its necessary foundation 
and fulﬁ llment in Christian faith and piety. The Liberal Arts
Augustine begins the body of his letter by criticizing those who ques-
tion how the Word could have “poured” himself into the ﬂ esh of Christ
Christology as Contemplative Practice 193
(infusus carni) so that in the incarnation God either abandoned control 
of all things or somehow located that control in the body of Christ. Such questions, Augustine tells us in familiar fashion, stem from an 
 inability to think beyond the basic conditions of material existence— 
spatial location and divisibility. 10 At the culmination of this argument 
Augustine recommends a practice of reﬂ ection on the immaterial soul 
and its powers of organizing and judging sense data: The human mind wonders at this and, because it does not grasp it, 
it perhaps does not believe it either. Let it ﬁ rst examine and wonder 
at itself [se ipsam primitus scrutata miretur]; let it, if it can, raise it-
self a little above the body and above those things that it is accus-
tomed to perceive through the body. But perhaps it cannot; a certain 
author [Cicero] says “It is a mark of great intelligence to separate 
the mind from the senses and to withdraw thought from famili-
arity with them.” Let it, then, examine those senses of the body in a 
somewhat different way and with greater care . . . .11 That Augustine would warn of the dangers of conceiving God in ma-
terial terms is no surprise: that he exhorts Volusianus to consider the 
power of the soul, and its ability to judge sense data, should, however, 
attract our close attention. The particular argument deployed here is 
one that ﬁ rst appears in Augustine’s early dialogues, where he attempts 
to demonstrate how the “liberal arts” exercise and train the mind. 12 In his earliest works Augustine describes the various artes liberales 
as a series of steps (gradus) for retraining the fallen intellect. 13",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=243

to demonstrate how the “liberal arts” exercise and train the mind. 12 In his earliest works Augustine describes the various artes liberales 
as a series of steps (gradus) for retraining the fallen intellect. 13 The dis-
ciplines provide conceptual tools for making logical distinctions and 
classiﬁ cations, as well as beliefs and principles that shape and sustain 
ways of using those distinctions and classiﬁ cations. Two such beliefs lie 
at the heart of Augustine’s account of the liberal arts: the distinction be-
tween the material and immaterial words, and the centrality of math-
ematical and geometrical proportion in ordering the cosmos. It is 
recognition of and meditation on this ordering that leads slowly toward 
a vision of the one divine power. At the same time, as one learns this 
content, one is led through exemplary practices of thought. 194 Lewis Ayres
Augustine uses the dialogue form of the early works primarily to 
model for his readers practices of thought that he believes will shape 
appropriate attention to the soul, the cosmos, and God. Thus, for ex-
ample, at De ordine 2.18.47 Augustine attempts to show how focusing 
attention on the synthesizing and unifying activity of the soul in the 
body (whether in the synthetic judging of sense data or in the seeking 
of unity with other people) may lead to a recognition of the harmonious 
unity of the cosmos and the importance of a life ordered according to 
the intrinsic measure or number of the soul.14 Reﬂ ection on this order 
prepares the soul for the sight of God.15 Similarly, at De musica 
6.2.2–6.5.12 the “Teacher” leads the “student” through a complex pro-
cess of reﬂ ection on the functions of the soul in the body. Recognition 
of the soul’s ability to judge according to harmonic principles is pro-
paedutic to reﬂ ection (beginning at 6.5.12) on the soul’s ability to turn 
toward or away from God, to be rightly or wrongly ordered toward the 
created order. 16
As Augustine’s vision of the Christian life developed in the years 
following his conversion, his understanding of the possible usefulness 
of the various liberal arts and the practices taught within them changed. In the earliest writings, memory is sidelined in favor of the possibility 
of training the mind for immediate vision or intuition of wisdom: but 
even by ca. 390 Augustine has abandoned much of this view. By the 
time of the Confessions (397–400) Augustine has, for all practical pur-
poses, deferred such immediate vision to the eschaton, thus investing 
the contents of the memory with an inescapable function in enabling 
thought of God.17",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=244

ingly clear that the mens, the highest part of the soul, is a mysterious 
unity: memory is now central to human identity. 18 This gradual devel-
opment enabled a new appreciation for the paeans to the signiﬁ cance of 
memory found among some of his favorite Roman rhetorical writers, 
particularly Cicero.19 The reformation of the memory through the 
work of grace now becomes central to the redemptive work of God.20
During the early 390s Augustine also developed an account of the 
text of Scripture as the central object of meditation for those seeking to 
understand themselves and their relationship to God. De doctrina chris-
tiana book 2 offers a clear statement of this—and has frequently been
Christology as Contemplative Practice 195
seen as the archetypal statement of a move away from the liberal arts. 21 In that book, Augustine describes some of the liberal arts as a useful 
propaedeutic to the work of exegesis, but he also strongly cautions 
against the pride that follows from placing too much store in one’s 
knowledge of them. 22 Against this possible pride, book 2 outlines ap-
propriate modes of humility in thinking and speaking before the divine 
mystery revealed in Scripture. Near the beginning of the book Augus-
tine offers a seven-stage account of ascent to wisdom, in which knowl-
edge that we walk in faith is the central thread. 23 At the ﬁ rst stage, fear 
of God inspires reﬂ ection (cogitatio) upon our mortality and possible 
punishment, thus inspiring holiness (pietas) and deference to Scripture. Augustine presents the third stage—that of knowledge and that at 
which the liberal arts begin to serve their propaedeutic function—as 
founded on awareness of our entanglement in love of this world and 
failure to exhibit the love that Scripture describes. 24 It is also with refer-
ence to this third stage that Augustine emphasizes how our prayer is 
answered by grace, that we might not despair. 25",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=245

trina 2 is the epistemological counterpart to the contemporary but more 
poetic account of Scripture as the “ﬁ rmament” set above us in Confes-
sions 13.26 It is, however, important to note that in both De doctrina and 
the Confessions the practices of thought that we ﬁ nd in the early works 
are not here condemned: Augustine only insists that they be under-
stood in the light of the practical inescapability of faith in this life and 
the demands of the particular form of humility that Christ teaches and 
models. We can identify three practices in particular from the latter half of 
the Confessions that persist throughout Augustine’s corpus. The ﬁ rst is 
the practice of reﬂ ecting on one’s soul, its nature and power, as a way of 
differentiating the orders of reality. 27 The second often follows closely 
on the ﬁ rst: the practice of reﬂ ecting on the difference between material 
existence and the immaterial in an attempt to identify and move be-
yond categories of time and space inadvertently predicated of spiritual 
or divine existence. 28 The third is reﬂ ection on the harmony of the di-
verse creation in the light of belief in its ordering by and dependence on 
the divine ordering. 29 Again, De doctrina christiana offers a more prosaic 
parallel: in De doctrina christiana book 1, Augustine explains that all

 attempt to think God, but only those who attempt to understand God 
through the intellect and as life itself are not mired in simple material 
imagery. Augustine then tells us how such people proceed in their 
thinking: Whatever corporeal form occurs to them, they establish that it 
 either lives or does not live; and they esteem what lives more highly 
than what does not . . . . Then they proceed to examine that life, 
and if they ﬁ nd it has energy but not sense (as in the case of trees) 
they subordinate it to a sentient form of life . . . .30 These techniques are then located as useful within the puriﬁ cation that 
is also a journey to our homeland made possible by Wisdom itself be-
coming visible in the ﬂ esh and laying down for us an exemplum vivendi, 
an example or pattern of living.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=246

has retooled the practices at the core of his vision of the liberal arts, 
turned them into exploratory tools that may also enable the practice 
and display of appropriate humility. 32 When we see Augustine begin his answer to Volusianus by recom-
mending a particular practice of reﬂ ection as the context within which 
questions about the incarnation may be answered, we must situate this 
recommendation within the story of Augustine’s engagement with the 
practices of thought taught by the liberal arts. In the ﬁ rst place, it is Au-
gustine’s continued use of some of these practices that enables him to 
begin to demonstrate Christianity’s philosophical respectability and 
make a claim on the cultural capital that gives Volusianus’s challenge 
its force within the elite circles of Carthage. Augustine recommends an 
exercising of the mind that incorporates standard aspects of the liberal 
arts tradition located within a Plotinian framework, a mix I suggest he 
hopes will be recognized by at least some of Volusianus’s circle as a cen-
tral part of contemporary Latin philosophical tradition. Moreover, Au-
gustine suggests this exercising of the mind via citation of the central 
authors of Latin tradition: it is Cicero who tells us to reﬂ ect on the 
mind’s existence beyond the senses. 33 In the second place, given Augustine’s adaptation of the liberal arts 
tradition in his mature writing, we should also expect Augustine to use 
discussion of these practices as the foundation for recommending to
Christology as Contemplative Practice 197
Volusianus Christian piety and humility as their condition of possibility 
and consummation. We have already begun to see Augustine’s use of 
classical citation to justify his very Christian self-presentation: when 
Augustine tells us of the great leisure and desire needed even to ap-
proach the profunditas of Scripture, he alludes to Cicero’s statement 
about the great leisure and desire that the Greeks have needed to grasp 
the vast ﬁ elds of learning with which the orator should be equipped. 34 While this letter can be read as an accommodation to the styles of argu-
ment found in Volusianus’s circle, it is also a carefully shaped piece of 
polemic against them.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=247

polemic against them. We can see further the twist that Augustine has learnt to apply to 
themes from the liberal arts tradition in his growing emphasis on the 
difﬁ culty that thinking the intelligible presents, and the attitude of 
wonder that should result from appropriate attention to it. Here, at the 
beginning of his answer, and after describing quickly some of the ques-
tions that arise in reﬂ ection on the soul and the senses, Augustine re-
turns to the question “What then is the soul . . . ?” The next sentence 
moves immediately to this difﬁ culty: “and we think we are told some-
thing incredible about the omnipotence of God when the Word of 
God . . . is said to have assumed a body . . . !”35 Reﬂ ection on the soul 
leads here both to the idea of an intelligible reality unmarked by com-
position or spatial location, and simultaneously to wonder at the very 
existence of the soul. In fact, turning to the central place that Augustine 
accords the recognition of that which should amaze will enable us to 
see with much more clarity the precise contours of the practice Augus-
tine has begun to suggest, and the full extent to which the argument 
in this letter depends on his Christian retooling of the liberal arts 
 tradition. The Power and the Mystery At the end of his initial discussion of what one learns by reﬂ ecting on 
the soul, Augustine offers a summary account of the Word. He deploys 
an analogy, one he has offered before in his corpus and will offer again. When we speak, syllables proceed in a temporal order, the second only
198 Lewis Ayres
being possible when the ﬁ rst has ended. Yet a hearer hears the whole 
and many hearers hear the whole: one spoken word sufﬁ ces for any 
number of hearers (within earshot). In the same manner the Word of 
God is omnipresent and cannot be grasped via material imagery. 36",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=248
249,"When we speak, syllables proceed in a temporal order, the second only

and many hearers hear the whole: one spoken word sufﬁ ces for any 
number of hearers (within earshot). In the same manner the Word of 
God is omnipresent and cannot be grasped via material imagery. 36 It is, 
however, important to note the tone of the analogy: What, however, is more amazing [mirabilius] than what happens in 
our shouts and sounding words, that is, in something quickly pass-
ing? . . . Now would it not be more incredible [potius incredibile] if 
the enduring Word of God did not offer to things what a passing 
word of a human being offers to the ears so that, just as a human 
word is heard at once as a whole by each individual, the Word of 
God is present as a whole everywhere at once? 37
Augustine uses the analogy to induce and model appropriate recogni-
tion of the mysterious, and thus to shift the character of our wonder at 
and imagination of God. Whereas his addressees have considered the 
incarnation to be in the category of the miraculous and have considered 
God within material categories, Augustine suggests that attention to 
the mysteriousness of the created order’s existence in the immaterial 
enables us to imagine the omnipresence of the Word as a plausible doc-
trine. By such an argument Augustine does not attempt to render di-
vine omnipresence fully comprehensible, making it analogous to inner-
worldly phenomena that we do comprehend. Instead he suggests a new 
style of attention to the mysterious presence of the sensible order in the 
intelligible. In the next section Augustine pursues this strategy in more depth. He insists that we must imagine God’s greatness not in terms of ma-
terial conditions but in terms of power (virtus). The character of God’s 
power is then shown by narrating its mysterious action in creating and 
sustaining all that we know. God creates speciﬁ c creatures each with 
their own often surprising capacities: “. . . he creates from the tiniest 
grain of seed greatness like that of the ﬁ g tree, though from much larger 
seeds many much smaller plants come to be. He expands a very small 
pupil by the gaze that shines forth from the eyes in a moment of time 
and surveys almost half the sky. ”38 This power, Augustine continues,
Christology as Contemplative Practice 199
accomplished the incarnation. The power that cannot be conﬁ ned fer-
tilized Mary’s womb and joined itself to the soul, hence constituting the 
person of Christ. Augustine offers this striking summary:",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=249

accomplished the incarnation. The power that cannot be conﬁ ned fer-
tilized Mary’s womb and joined itself to the soul, hence constituting the 
person of Christ. Augustine offers this striking summary: If a reason is asked for, it will not be miraculous [hic si ratio quaeri-
tur, non erit mirabile]; if an example is demanded, it will not be sin-
gular. Let us grant that God can do something that we admit that 
we cannot search out. In such cases the whole reason for what is 
done lies in the power of the agent [In talibus rebus tota ratio facti est 
potentia facientis]. 39 In these dense sentences we ﬁ nd a summary of the lessons Augus-
tine wishes Volusianus to learn from the exercitatio played out for him 
in the preceding paragraphs. Appropriate practices of attention to and 
reﬂ ection on the created order teach us that the incarnation is not mira-
bilis, that is, not extraordinary in the sense of incomprehensible by the 
standards of our knowledge of the cosmos. Intrinsic to these practices is 
an intellectual humility that not only enables recognition of that which 
remains beyond our epistemological grasp, but also points toward fur-
ther investigation of the power of God within the created order. Prac-
tices that were originally intended to enable recognition of the inform-
ing of the sensible by the intelligible now are also intended to shape a 
heightened sense of the mysterious ordering and governance of the sen-
sible by the divine power. We should, however, note that at this point 
Augustine’s sense of the distinction between “intelligible” and “sen-
sible” has taken on a very particular Christian ﬂ avor: the recognition of 
the informing of the sensible by the intelligible is always also a recogni-
tion of the necessity of faith in the face of the weakness of the “eyes of 
the heart.” The Mystery of Union We are now ready to consider the paragraphs of the letter that have 
 attracted most scholarly attention. Augustine introduces his analogy 
between the two natures and the body and soul with these words:
200 Lewis Ayres But there are some who request an explanation of how God is 
joined to the human being so as to become the single person of 
Christ when it was necessary that it be done once, as if they them-
selves could explain something that happens every day, namely 
how the soul is joined to the body so as to form the single person of 
a human being. For just as the soul uses the body in the unity of the 
person in order that a person might exist, so God uses the man in 
the unity of the person in order that Christ might exist.40",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=250

reﬂ ection and (hence) in appropriate reﬂ ection on the structure of cre-
ation would not request an explanation of the incarnation. Only those 
who think that they are able to explain the quotidian event of the union 
of soul and body would think it possible to explain the unique event of 
the incarnation. Augustine thus subtly criticizes his addressees as philo-
sophically unsophisticated and inattentive—here they are insufﬁ ciently 
attentive to the nature of soul and body. The second sentence points 
back to the ﬁ rst: nam sicut (for just as . . .) indicates that the second is ex-
planatory of the ﬁ rst. But the analogy is offered within the framework 
of the previous sentence’s statement of the impossibility of grasping 
 either the union of natures in Christ or the union of soul and body in a 
human being. Thus, the second sentence gives the grounds for Augus-
tine’s comparison in the ﬁ rst sentence: he can compare the attitude of 
his addressees to these two examples of union because they are indeed 
parallel—just as the soul uses the body so that there might be a human 
person, so God uses a human being so that there might be the unity of 
Christ’s person. Augustine is saying in effect that just as the soul’s union 
with the body is real and yet incomprehensible, so too the union of na-
tures in Christ is real (hence the new use of persona to name the meta-
physical reality) and yet incomprehensible. This reading receives further conﬁ rmation when a little later Au-

to be more plausible (at least insofar as they do not question its pos-
sibility), they should logically see that the union of natures in the Word
Christology as Contemplative Practice 201
is the more plausible. The point is, of course, intended rhetorically, em-
phasizing the incomprehensibility of the person of Christ and adding 
more force to the argument that the questions his addressees have 
asked stem from inappropriate attention to themselves, the cosmos, 
and God. When Augustine speaks of the soul “using” the body, he employs a 
terminology that was occasionally offered in the ancient world as a way 
of describing the type of union involved in a human person. It is, how-
ever, noticeable that Augustine places no weight on this language here: 
the fact that the soul uses the body and the Word uses the human being 
in Christ helps to show the possibility of the analogy, but the terminol-
ogy does no further work in explaining how these unions work. 42 Thus, 
Augustine sees the union of soul and body as a persistent problem that 
is heightened when one recognizes that a unitary person results, but 
he does not offer a particular model of union as a comprehensible anal-
ogy for understanding the two natures of Christ.43 The analogy is in-

may not be grasped: the mode of union of the two natures. 44 It is important to note that while it is clear in general terms that 
Augustine wishes to inculcate a reﬂ ective practice founded on attention 
to the mysterious ordering of the cosmos by the divine, he simultane-
ously views this practice as enabling a certain precision in christological 
formulation. Such precision is based on attention to the language of 
faith—the language of Scripture and what may be inferred from it 
within the context of Augustine’s exegetical practice. In the ﬁ rst place, 
Augustine is clear that we may make a number of statements about the 
positive character of Christ’s person based on the needs of his mission. Thus we should confess that Christ’s humanity included both a body 
and a soul and that the Word who assumed ﬂ esh was fully God. We 
must also assume that Christ was one agent. Augustine is also precise

about what may and may not be understood about the union. We can 
be clear that it occurs through the divine power. But, and also hence, we 
can be sure that we cannot understand how it occurs: the mode of union 
remains beyond us. The better we understand that through the incar-
nation the divine power reﬂ ected as mystery in the creation takes up the 
“ordinary” into the “extra-ordinary,”45 the more we will come to recog-
nize that the union of natures cannot be understood: contemplation of 
its mysteriousness is contemplation of the core of the mystery of re-
demption itself. Thus, the developments in Augustine’s Christology 
signaled by his use of nature and person language is also a precision 
about what must remain mysterious to Christians.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=253

the letter would be missed if we did. EXEMPLUM CHRISTI
Augustine has attempted to render the incarnation plausible to Volusi-
anus by arguing both for a doctrine of divine omnipresence and for 
particular intellectual practices that will shape the mind to appreciate 
the relationship between Creator and creation. Only in the context of 
these practices can the mystery of Christ’s mission and person be use-
fully discussed. In the latter half of the letter, Augustine makes a sig-
niﬁ cant addition to his account by presenting the incarnation as struc-
tured for teaching the account of divine omnipresence that he has been 
suggesting. At the same time, he argues that the incarnation recom-
mends to us the very practices that he has described, practices of thought 
and contemplation founded in faith and Christian pietas. After offering the body/soul analogy discussed in the previous sec-
tion of this essay, Augustine outlines three aspects of the Word’s mis-
sion. Second in the list, but most important, Christ’s exemplum persuades 
human beings that God need not be approached through intermediary 
powers: “God is so close to the piety of human beings that he deigned to 
assume a human being.”46 The humility of Christ is here presented as 
teaching the doctrine of divine omnipresence. Overcoming the practice 
of seeking the help of intermediary powers does not reveal God as a
Christology as Contemplative Practice 203
 superior and more distant power: it reveals the possibility of our direct 
approach to the omnipresent ordering and governing divine life. 47 There is, however, also an intrinsic link between the doctrine that 
Christ teaches and the manner in which he teaches us to seek under-
standing of it. It is the willingness of the Word to become ﬂ esh that 
 reveals the omnipresence of God; it is the same willingness that reveals 
to us the need for humility in our response. 48",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=254
255,"47 There is, however, also an intrinsic link between the doctrine that 
Christ teaches and the manner in which he teaches us to seek under-
standing of it. It is the willingness of the Word to become ﬂ esh that 
 reveals the omnipresence of God; it is the same willingness that reveals 
to us the need for humility in our response. 48 In his reference to the 
 profunditas of Scripture at the beginning of the letter, Augustine states 
that faith is the foundation of a life of piety: in these latter sections of the 
 letter, Augustine describes faith as providing an “opening to the under-
standing” of doctrinal questions. 49 Fides here bears the heavy weight it 
does throughout Augustine’s mature corpus: it refers not only to par-
ticular beliefs but also to the attitude of appropriate trust and inquiry 
that should shape our attention to the events narrated in Scripture. Christ offers material for humble faith and through the sending of the 
Spirit shows that such faith is an opening to understanding.50 God is 
thus close to human pietas in the sense that God provides exactly what 
piety needs. We may see further dimensions of this argument by turning to the 
ﬁ rst aspect of Christ’s teaching that Augustine discusses. Christ con-
ﬁ rms not only the teaching of the prophets but also the true teachings 
of secular writers. 51 Christ does not, however, conﬁ rm simply by repeat-
ing truths found in non-Christian traditions: through inculcating cor-
rect faith, Christ enables even the unlearned of his followers to grasp 
such truths. Thus belief in the immortality of the soul was originally 
the preserve of only a few philosophers: now the work of God through 
Christ and Spirit has made it (according to Augustine) a universal be-
lief.52 Toward the end of the letter Augustine comments on the value of 
the Scriptures in relation to the writings of the philosophers to make a 
similar point. The three divisions of philosophy—physics, ethics, and 
logic—are all contained in Scripture: but the style of the Scriptures is 
such that they are accessible to all, enabling faith in all and yet exercis-
ing  appropriately the minds of all able to grasp deeper mysteries. 53 Thus 
Christianity’s “conﬁ rmation” of the philosophers involves a reorganiz-
ing of their conceptions of philosophical practice. The church still pos-
sesses an intellectual elite comprised of those with the abilities to explore

tine offers a brief sketch of the church as a socially and intellectually di-
verse community of believers, subjecting to Christ “the most brilliant 
minds . . . [and converting them] to preach the way of piety and salva-
tion.”54 If attempts to know God are completed by realization of the 
need for salvation (only thus can any sight of God be permanently ob-
tained), the practices of the liberal arts are completed by their incorpo-
ration into the way of piety. The incarnate Christ draws Christians into 
a teaching that directly parallels and yet trumps that offered by the lib-
eral arts: paralleling the liberal arts by initiating all into a new vision of 
the relationship between Creator and creation; trumping them by pro-
viding the means for the achievement of a vision that is denied the prac-
titioner of the liberal arts in their non-Christian avatars. The signiﬁ cance of faith is further reinforced when we note the 
third aspect of the Word’s mission that Augustine mentions: that of the 
adiutorium who provides the grace of faith that is the foundation of any 
puriﬁ cation and forgiveness. This emphasis on grace complements the 
emphasis on faith, further adding to the relocation of the intellectual 
practices adapted from the liberal arts. The philosophical task is now 
on a continuum with the faith of illiterate Christians: the dependence 
of all on the gift of faith further reveals the church as the new social 
 location for good philosophical reﬂ ection. Conclusion
Augustine mounts a challenge to Volusianus’s circle in Letter 137 by de-
lineating a conception of intellectual practice that initially claims its su-
periority in terms internal to late-antique philosophical debate. Practices 
of thought and contemplation that originate in Augustine’s early writ-
ing on the liberal arts are suggested as rendering plausible incarnational 
doctrine. And yet, these practices have been adapted so that Augustine 
may present them as fulﬁ lled by Christian piety.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=256

the incarnate Christ himself who serves as the model for the approach
Christology as Contemplative Practice 205
to knowledge of God that Augustine describes. At the heart of the 
practices Augustine recommends to Volusianus are patterns of atten-
tion to the created order. Long after the epistemological optimism of 
Augustine’s early writings on the liberal arts has faded, he continues to 
present attention to the created order’s mysterious revealing of the di-
vine power as an essential part of the context within which Christian 
faith should be considered and explored. The remarkable sophistica-
tion of his account is seen in the transformation he effects in our reﬂ ec-
tion on the creation. In Letter 137 Augustine shapes what to modern 
eyes may seem a “reverse apologetics,” in which the reasonableness of 
Christian doctrine is sketched not by ﬁ nding a comprehensible analogy 
within our normal experience, but by expanding our vision of the in-
comprehensible until our reasoning about the created order and our vi-
sion in faith of the uncreated begin to complement each other. 55 In this 
new context the language of faith guides an analogical exploration of its 
own reﬂ ections in the creation—analogy becomes an exercitatio mentis 
for the one seeking greater understanding of the language of faith. Against this background it becomes much clearer that Augustine’s 
brief discussion of the union of natures in Letter 137 is not intended 
to enable our comprehension of Christ’s person. Augustine is rather 
sketch ing a context within which Volusianus can recognize with preci-
sion what must remain incomprehensible about that union. Indeed, 
even though Augustine’s account of the person of Christ is inchoate in 
comparison to those appearing in the wake of the christological con-
troversies it is interesting to note that Augustine anticipates one of

with precision that which is one in Christ (other than his persona or 
hypostasis)—whether it is “nature” or “will”—are ultimately rejected 
not because Christ is primarily to be understood as two realities, but be-
cause the mode of union that results in the unity of his person depends 
on the action of the divine power and is by deﬁ nition incomprehensible. The great and venerable work of contemplating the union of natures in 
Christ may and must deliver us precision in our thinking, but that pre-
cision facilitates our growing awareness of the incomprehensibility of 
exactly how Christ is one without confusion or change. 206 Lewis Ayres
If Letter 137 reveals to us some of the initial context for the emer-
gence of the City of God, it does not do so simply because questions 
about the relationship between Christians and the state are among the 
questions that Volusianus and Marcellinus pose to Augustine. Letter 
137 demonstrates, rather, that questions about the doctrine of the incar-
nation are for Augustine inseparable from questions about the context 
within which Christian doctrine is explored and questioned. These 
doctrinal questions thus lead Augustine inevitably to reﬂ ect on the lo-
cation of appropriate thinking within and without the City of God: 
Christology necessarily becomes hermeneutics, epistemology, and so-
cial theory if it is to be seen in its full rationality and beauty. Notes 1. Maximus Confessor, Ambigua 5 (PG 91.1057A). 2. I thank Andy Gallwitz, Ian McFarland, John Rist, Thomas Weinandy,

there is little evidence for this argument and teases apart the “close” parallels 
Fortin alleges between Augustine, Nemesius, and Priscianus. 6. Cf. PLRE 2:1184–85 and A. Chastagnol, “Le sénateur Volusien et la 
conversion d’une famille de l’aristocratie romaine au Bas-Empire,” Revue des 
études anciennes 58 (1956): 240–53. We can be reasonably certain of the date be-
fore which Volusianus was Proconsulis africae because in late 411, Apryngius, the 
brother of Marcellinus, was appointed to this position. 7. Ep. 135.2 (CSEL 44.92): “at cum ad antistitem Augustinum venitur, legi 
deest quidquid contigerit ignorari.” We should not assume Augustine had con-
stant and easy access to such inﬂ uential ﬁ gures. We may fairly read into Augus-
tine’s response a desire to demonstrate his ability to engage in appropriate 
discussion with such circles. See N. McLynn, “Augustine’s Roman Empire,” 
 Augustinian Studies 30 (1999): 29–44. 8. This particular exchange is also only part of an extended conversation 
that continued until Marcellinus’s execution in 413. Ep. 138 to Marcellinus con-
stitutes an addition to Ep. 137, in which Augustine addresses more directly the 
additional questions the tribunus had raised in Ep. 135. Marcellinus’s role in the 
production of two of Augustine’s early texts against Pelagius is also noteworthy. Pecc. merit. was written at the request of Marcellinus (begun in the winter of 
411) and Spir. et litt. (412) was stimulated by further queries from him. 9. Interestingly, Volusianus’s letter contains no clear reference to Platonic 
doctrine or tradition. In Letter 136, however, Marcellinus mentions the second-
century North African Middle-Platonist Apuleius of Madaura as one example 
of a person with magical powers cited by Volusianus’s friends. Augustine as-
sumes his addressees have knowledge of traditions that envisage daemons as di-
vine powers that are “heavenly” and “intermediate” (potestates caelestis, potestates 
interpositas).",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=260

development of models for organizing the liberal arts in antiquity and Augus-
tine’s place in that tradition. Among the wealth of recent literature, I. Hadot’s 
Arts libéraux et philosophie dans la pensée antique (Paris: Études Augustiniennes, 
1984) is particularly notable. Virgilio Pacioni, L’Unità Teoretica del De Ordine di 
S. Agostino (Rome: Millenium Romae, 1996), offers, however, a better guide to 
the diversity of inﬂ uences (including that of Varro) that may be discerned in 
 Augustine’s account of the liberal arts. Danuta R. Shanzer, “Augustine’s Dis-
ciplines: Silent diutius Musae Varronis?” in Augustine and the Disciplines, ed. 
K. Pollman and M. Vessey (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005), 69–112, offers fur-
ther argument for Varronian inﬂ uence. 13. Ord. 2.12.35ff. Cf. Sol. 2.20.35. The latter text warns against “mistaken” 
construals of the liberal arts, thus revealing contemporary debate about how one 
understands their nature and purpose. Augustine follows a common pattern 
among late antique authors in understanding the ancient disciplines within a 
Neoplatonic framework: for the signiﬁ cance of this context, see the literature 
mentioned in the previous note. 14. Ord. 2.18.48–19.50. 15. Ord. 2.19.51. 16. Further good examples of these practices are provided by Quant. an.

with a call to the soul to consider its measurement of time. This reﬂ ection en-
ables recognition of the ability of the mind to measure time, but then also recog-
nition of its own distention in the world and the possibility of moving toward 
the stability to be found in God (11.30.40). 28. E.g., Augustine’s description at Conf. 12.4.4ff. of his inner conversation 
or cogitatio as he attempts to understand the reality of the unformed nature of 
the world described at Gen 1:1. He describes in formal terms an attempt to 
think beyond material imagery. Considering the mutability of things leads 
him to recognize God as their author and hence the immutability of the divine. 29. The example given in the previous note also involves recognition of the 
soul’s place within the created order. A further example is provided by the intro-
duction to the famous exploration of memory at Conf. 10.6.9–10. The discussion 
of memory itself which follows can be added to the previous note as a further il-
lustration of the soul’s reﬂ ection on its own nature. 30. Doctr. chr. 1.8.8.17–18. 31. Doctr. chr. 1.10.10.22–23. 32. The examples I have given in the notes here are, of course, taken from 
a work addressed to an elite audience—as is Ep. 137. In my Augustine and the 
Trinity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, forthcoming, 2009) I offer a 
parallel reading of the De Trinitate which emphasizes the continuing signiﬁ -
cance of these practices in that text (in so doing I am also suggesting the impor-
tance of Marrou’s insistence on the importance of dialectic in the De Trinitate: 
see his Saint Augustin, 315–27). In briefer and much simpliﬁ ed forms these prac-
tices can also be found throughout his homiletic corpus. For a very useful re-
cent discussion of the relationship between his homiletic practice and the longer 
treatises, see John Cavadini, “Simplifying Augustine,” in Educating People of 
Faith: Exploring the History of Jewish and Christian Communities, ed. J. Van 
Engen (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2004), 63–84. 33. Ep. 137.2.5. The reference is to Cicero, Tusc. 1.16.38. There may well be 
an echo of the same text in Conf. 7.17.23’s “abduxit cogitationem a consuetu-
dine,” where Augustine describes his initial insight into the nature of reason and 
immaterial truth after reading the “Platonists” (cf. O’Donnell 2.457). 34. Ep. 137.1.3. Cf. Cicero, De or. 1.6.22.

a number of times in his homiletic corpus, e.g. Serm. 247.2. Cf. also Trin. 3.8.13: 
following the arguments of Pierre-Marie Hombert, Nouvelles Recherches de 
Chronologie Augustinienne (Paris: Études Augustiniennes, 2000), 62–66, we may 
note that Trin. 3 and Ep. 137 are probably contemporary. 39. Ep. 137.2.8 (CSEL 44.107). 40. Ep. 137.3.11 (CSEL 44.109–10): “Sic autem quidam reddi sibi rationem 
ﬂ agitant, quo modo deus homini permixtus sit, ut una ﬁ eret persona Christi, 
cum hoc semel ﬁ eri oportuerit, quasi rationem ipsi reddant de re, quae cotidie 
ﬁ t, quo modo misceatur anima corpori, ut una persona ﬁ at hominis. Nam sicut 
in unitate personae anima utitur corpore, ut homo sit, ita in unitate personae 
deus utitur homine, ut Christus sit.” 41. Ep. 137.3.11 (CSEL 44.110): “verum tamen duarum rerum incor-
porearum commixtio facilius credi debuit quam unius incorporeae et alterius 
corporeae . . . .” 42. Thus, for example, the language is considered by Plotinus at Enn. 1.1.4. It stems originally from ps.-Plato, Alcibiades I 129–30. The best summary dis-
cussion of Augustine’s language here is John Rist, Augustine: Ancient Thought 
Baptized (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 97–104. 43. Here we see perhaps further conﬁ rmation of Rist’s arguments in his 
“Pseudo-Ammonius.” In Ep. 137 Augustine’s discussion of the union of body 
and soul similarly depends on it being an insoluble paradox, not on any preexist-
ing theory that describes the type of union involved. 44. In response to an earlier draft of this essay, James Wetzel suggested that 
one might term this the “ironic use” of analogy. Augustine certainly intends us 
to draw, in a loose sense, an analogy here: and yet the point of the analogy is 
grasped only when the intentional ironies of its deployment are grasped. In this 
essay I have not considered Augustine’s other uses of the body/soul analogy for 
the constitution of Christ’s person.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=264

human life in which was fully proclaimed the grace of salvation, we would not 
be able to grasp that God lifts up human nature through a mediator who is both 
divine and human (and not through any ontological intermediary). 48. R. Dodaro’s Christ and the Just Society in Augustine (Cambridge: Cam-
bridge University Press, 2004), chaps. 4 and 5, offers an important supplement 
to the argument here by describing with a new clarity the ways in which Augus-

ciation for the divine mystery. 49. Ep. 137.4.15 (CSEL 44.117): “intellectui ﬁ des aditum aperit, inﬁ delitas

1:543–50, argued that Augustine’s understanding of the human being’s unity 
was fundamentally governed by his christological premises and is thus best la-
beled “hypostatic.” With some nuance we should, I suggest, reﬂ ect carefully on 
his account. In the course of Ep. 137 Augustine seems to present us with a view 
of the human being as fundamentally resistant to our comprehension because it 
is a unity brought about by divine power. The argument that Augustine offers 
involves the Christian in recognizing the extent to which the incarnation pro-
vides a model for our contemplation of the creation and of ourselves. We most 
fruitfully understand the mystery of our composite and yet uniﬁ ed nature by 
seeing the analogies and distinctions between our existence and that of the incar-
nate Christ. 10
What Was “Wrong” with Augustine? The Sixth-Century Reception (or Lack Thereof) 
of Augustine’s Christology
David R. Maxwell A 
christological controversy erupted in Constantinople in the ﬁ rst 
  decades of the sixth century, which quickly expanded to include a 
controversy about grace. A group of monks from Scythia, who were in 
Constantinople to get a hearing for their christological views, fought 
both fronts of this battle. They relied, however, on separate authorities 
for each front. For Christology, they drew primarily on the writings of 
Cyril of Alexandria to oppose what they saw as a Nestorianizing misin-
terpretation of the Chalcedonian deﬁ nition. For the doctrine of grace, 
they drew primarily on the writings of Augustine to oppose a semi- 
Pelagian understanding of human cooperation in conversion. This di-
vision of labor raises the question of why they did not draw consistently 
on one author or the other.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=266

cialist on grace, so to speak, but show little interest in his christological 
formulations? What was “wrong” with Augustine’s Christology that 
prevented the Scythian monks from relying on him as a primary wit-
ness for their own christological position? Brieﬂ y, I argue in this essay 
212
What Was “Wrong” with Augustine? 213
that when Augustine’s Christology was thrust into a new context, that 
of the Nestorian controversy, his formulations took on a different 
meaning because they bore a superﬁ cial resemblance to certain “Nesto-
rian” formulations, even though they were never intended to address 
the questions posed by the later controversy. In order to trace this shift in meaning, I ﬁ rst provide a brief sum-
mary of the sixth-century “Theopaschite controversy,” which is really a 
continuation of the Nestorian controversy. After that, I determine 
which Augustinian texts the Scythian monks had available to them. I 
am then in a position to describe three features of Augustine’s Chris-
tology which underwent a transformation and began to look “Nes-
torian” when they were read in the new context of the Theopaschite 
controversy. These features are, ﬁ rst, a “rule of interpretation” that Au-
gustine articulated in De Trinitate; second, Augustine’s account of why 
Christ is called God; and third, Augustine’s inclusion of the concept of 
grace in his Christology. The Theopaschite Controversy In the year 519, a group of monks from Scythia, led by John Maxentius, 
arrived in Constantinople in order to gain approval from the emperor 
for their “theopaschite formula,” “One of the Trinity was cruciﬁ ed in 
the ﬂ esh.” The Scythian monks advocated this formula because they 
were concerned that many, including their home bishop in the town of 
Tomi, misinterpreted the Chalcedonian deﬁ nition in a Nestorianizing 
direction. Leo’s Tome, for example, which was endorsed by Chalcedon, 
states, “Each form [i.e., nature] does what is proper to it in communion 
with the other, the Word, that is, doing what belongs to the Word, and 
the ﬂ esh carrying out what belongs to the ﬂ esh. One of these shines 
with miracles; the other succumbs to injuries.”1",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=267

with miracles; the other succumbs to injuries.”1 A statement such as this 
could easily be taken to posit two different acting subjects in Christ. The Scythian monks did not believe that Chalcedon or Leo actu-
ally intended to divide Christ in two. They themselves were ardent 
supporters of the Chalcedonian deﬁ nition, and they culled Leo’s letters 
for evidence that he did in fact believe there is only one subject in Christ. Their concern was that their contemporaries, including a group of
214 David R. Maxwell
monks in Constantinople as well as legates from Rome, were misread-
ing Chalcedon by taking advantage of ambiguities like the above pas-
sage from Leo’s Tome in order to divide the actions of Christ between a 
human and a divine subject. The Scythian monks advocated their theopaschite formula as a 
kind of litmus test to unmask just such a Nestorianizing interpretation 
of the council. The formula “One of the Trinity was cruciﬁ ed in the 
ﬂ esh” was intended to make clear that everything that Christ under-
went, including the cruciﬁ xion, was experienced by “One of the 
 Trinity,” namely, the Word. If one could confess the theopaschite for-
mula along with Chalcedon, the Scythian monks argued, Chalcedon 
was defended against a Nestorianizing misinterpretation that would 
ascribe the sufferings of Christ to some subject other than the Word. In addition to the controversy about the reception of Chalcedon, a 
semi-Pelagian controversy erupted in Constantinople at the same time 
when the North African bishop Possessor attempted to cite Faustus of 
Riez against the Scythian monks. In response to Possessor, the Scythian 
monks showed themselves to be ardent Augustinians, afﬁ rming origi-
nal sin and the inability of human beings to will anything pertaining to 
eternal life without the internal operation of the Holy Spirit.2 Corresponding to these two facets of their controversy, the Scyth-
ian monks produced a number of documents characterized by a two-
fold structure. In the ﬁ rst part, they dealt with Christ, and in the second 
part, they dealt with the doctrine of grace.3",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=268

grace, they drew primarily on Augustine. As I said earlier, this pattern 
raises the question of why they did not draw consistently on Augustine 
for their entire theological argumentation. The implication seems to be 
that there was something less than helpful about Augustine’s Chris-
tology. Augustinian Sources In order to describe what that problem might be, we must ﬁ rst deter-
mine which works of Augustine the Scythian monks knew so that we 
may have some idea of the christological material from Augustine that
What Was “Wrong” with Augustine? 215
was available to them. If we limit ourselves to verbatim or near- 
verbatim citations, the works of Augustine most frequently cited by the 
Scythian monks were De Trinitate and De praedestinatione sanctorum. By my count, they cited De praedestinatione sanctorum eight times in 
their corpus of writings, while they cited De Trinitate six times. The 
other works they cited were De haeresibus (three times), the Enchiridion 
(twice), and Sermo 80 (once).4 Determining what works they cited, however, does not prove that 
they had access to these works in their entirety. At least two ﬂ orilegia in 
existence at the time were relevant to the Theopaschite controversy: the 
Exempla sanctorum patrum, which marshalled evidence in support of 
the phrase “One of the Trinity,” and the Capitula sancti Augustini, which 
dealt with issues of sin, grace, predestination, and anthropology.5 By examining more carefully their citations of Augustine, how-
ever, it is possible to determine that the Scythian monks did, in fact, 
have access to the entire treatises from which they cited, at least in the 
cases of De Trinitate, De praedestinatione sanctorum, and the Enchiridion. That is because the Scythian monks displayed an awareness of the con-

point of Christology for which the Scythian monks did draw on Au-
gustine: their phrase unus ex Trinitate. Their opponents charged that 
this phrase was a novelty that introduced division into the Godhead. In 
response, the Scythian monks brought forward a number of passages 
from Augustine that employed similar phrases, and as they cited them, 
they gave some indication of the context of the passages. For example, 
when the Scythian monks adduced a passage in the Enchiridion that 
uses the phrase unus trium to describe a person of the Trinity, a phrase 
quite similar to their own unus ex Trinitate, they were able to specify 
that the passage occured in the context of Augustine’s discussion of the 
statement “God the Word was born of the Holy Spirit and the virgin 
Mary.”6 Again, when the Scythian monks cited two passages from book 
2 of De Trinitate that employed the phrase aliqua ex Trinitate persona, 
they were able to specify that the second passage occurred “a little later” 
than the ﬁ rst.7 Although each of the above-mentioned passages appears 
in the Exempla sanctorum patrum, these contextual cues do not.8
216 David R. Maxwell The case is even stronger for De praedestinatione sanctorum. John 
Maxentius cited this work numerous times in his response to a letter 
from Pope Hormisdas. The North African bishop Possessor, who had 
cited Faustus of Riez against the Scythian monks, wrote Hormisdas, 
criticizing the Scythian monks. Hormisdas replied with his own sting-
ing criticism of the Scythian monks, but the pope differed from Pos-
sessor in one respect: he refused to view Faustus of Riez as an authority. In fact, he declared that the doctrine of the Roman church on free will 
and grace was found especially in Augustine’s work Ad Hilarium et 
Prosperum, referring to the twin work, De praedestinatione sanctorum 
and De dono perseverantiae.9",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=270

sion and proceeded to discredit Faustus of Riez (and Possessor) by op-
posing Faustus point for point with passages from Augustine’s De 
praedestinatione sanctorum. When Maxentius identiﬁ ed the citations 
from Augustine he wanted to use, he displayed a knowledge of the pas-
sages’ contexts. He was able to say, for example, that one passage was 
found “a little bit after what he says about the beginning of faith.”10 
Other contextual cues may be found in a number of places throughout 
the same work. 11 In the case of these citations from De praedestinatione 
sanctorum, not even the passages, much less the context indicators, are 
found in either of the ﬂ orilegia. These contextual cues, taken together, establish that the Scythian 
monks were not citing Augustine from ﬂ orilegia. They were familiar 
with the contexts in which the passages they cited occurred. At least in 
the cases of Augustine’s De Trinitate, Enchiridion, and De praedestina-
tione sanctorum, we can be fairly conﬁ dent that the Scythian monks had 
the treatises in their entirety. This fact is signiﬁ cant because these three 
works have much to say about Christ that the Scythian monks chose 
not to use. I hope the reasons for this decision will become obvious when 
the polemical context of the Scythian monks is taken into account. In the three sections that follow, I identify three salient features of 
Augustine’s Christology. First, Augustine articulated a rule of exegesis 
in De Trinitate that correlated different actions of Christ to one or the 
other of his two natures. Second, he asserted that Christ was called God 
because God assumed him. Third, in the Enchiridion and De praedesti-
natione sanctorum, he employed the term “grace” in his discussion of

Christology. In each of these three cases, Augustine’s language would 
have sounded uncomfortably close to the language that the Scythian 
monks attributed to their opponents.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=271

Christology. In each of these three cases, Augustine’s language would 
have sounded uncomfortably close to the language that the Scythian 
monks attributed to their opponents. Augustine’s Rule of Interpretation
A major christological emphasis of Augustine’s De Trinitate, arising 
from his anti-Arian concern, was to show that scriptural statements 
that imply that the Son is less than the Father or that ascribe to Christ 
obviously human characteristics do not contradict the teaching that he 
is God. To this end, Augustine applied a rule of interpretation, which 
he derived from Philippians 2:6, that those statements which imply that 
the Son is equal to the Father are made on the basis of the form of God 
in which he was, while those statements which imply that he is less than 
the Father are made on the basis of the form of a slave which he took 
on.12 This rule gave Augustine’s Christology a rhetorically balanced 
shape. Christ did some things according to the form of God, while he 
did others according to the form of a slave. In that respect, Augustine’s 
Christology would ﬁ nd a later echo in Leo’s Tome, which stated, as we 
have already seen above, that “each form does what is proper to it.” This rhetorical balance, however, became a liability in an anti- 
Nestorian context. Against what they perceived to be a Nestorianizing 
reading of Chalcedon that posited two acting subjects in Christ, the

273,"This rhetorical balance, however, became a liability in an anti- 
Nestorian context. Against what they perceived to be a Nestorianizing 
reading of Chalcedon that posited two acting subjects in Christ, the 
Scythian monks advocated an asymmetrical Christology in which the 
Word was the only acting subject. To their ears, the balanced style of 
Leo’s Tome, or Augustine’s De Trinitate (I suggest), while not Nestorian 
in itself, could easily be taken to imply two subjects in Christ. Indeed, Augustine was capable of speaking of Christ’s human na-
ture in ways that sounded like it was a separate acting subject. He said, 
for example, “Because the form of God took on the form of a servant, 
each is God and each is man, but each is God because of God taking on, 
and each is man because of man taken on [acceptum hominem].”13 Or 
again, “Accordingly, since the Son is both God and man, God is one 
substance and the man is another, but it is the man in the Son rather 
than the Son in the Father [who differs in substance].”14 The rhetorical
218 David R. Maxwell
balance of these statements, along with their tendency to treat “form of 
a servant” or “man” as a concrete noun, could easily have suggested that 
“God” and “man” in the last analysis acted independently from one 
 another. That is not to say that Augustine actually intended two separate 
acting subjects in Christ. He stated elsewhere, for example, that “it is 
the same only begotten Son of the Father who is both in the form of a 
servant and in the form of God.”15 Because of this identity, Augustine 
could maintain that the human attributes applied to the only-begotten 
Son. “For he was cruciﬁ ed as a result of the form of a slave [ex forma 
servi], and nevertheless the Lord of Glory was cruciﬁ ed. For that taking 
on [of the man by God] was such that it made God a man, and it made 
the man God. ”16
Nevertheless, Augustine’s rule of interpretation partook in the 
same ambiguity as Leo’s Tome once De Trinitate was read in an anti-
Nestorian context. Presumably, the Scythian monks regarded Augus-
tine’s Christology in De Trinitate like they regarded Leo’s Christology: 
it was orthodox, but its rhetorical balance, assigning some things to 
God and others to the man, needed to be clariﬁ ed and shored up against 
a Nestorianizing misinterpretation. 17 This need for defense was particularly urgent because Cyril of Al-
exandria anathematized a similar interpretive procedure on the part of 
Nestorius. Cyril stated his position most succinctly in the fourth anath-
ema of his third letter to Nestorius:",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=273

Christ by the saints or by him about himself, and attaches some to

anathema.18 The Scythian monks were well aware of Cyril’s position since they had 
access to this letter through a Latin translation produced by Dionysius 
Exiguus. When the emperor Zeno, in 482, attempted to unify the empire on 
the basis of Cyril of Alexandria’s Christology, he issued a statement

known as the Henotikon that expressed a similar concern. Implicitly 
correcting, or at least interpreting, Leo’s statement that each form does 
what is proper to it, the Henotikon stated, “We say that both the mira-
cles and the passions that he endured willingly in the ﬂ esh belong to 
one [subject].”19 This unease over Chalcedon was shared not only by the 
so-called “Monophysites” in the East, to whom the Henotikon was in-
tended to appeal, but also by committed Chalcedonians such as the 
Scythian monks, who recognized an ambiguity in the way that Chalce-
don confessed the unity of Christ. Accordingly, the Scythian monks also stressed that both the mira-
cles and the passions applied to the Word,20 while they portrayed their 
opponents as wanting to separate the miracles and the passions, so that 
God worked the miracles, while (the man) Jesus Christ endured the 
suffering. 21 The Scythian monks sometimes pressed this point home by 
reversing the normal rule as expressed by Augustine and Leo; they af-
ﬁ rmed that, according to his humanity, God was born of a virgin, hun-
gered, thirsted, was cruciﬁ ed, pierced, and so on, and that, according to 
his divinity, the Son of Man, or simply the man, was born of the Father 
before the ages, was one of the Trinity, was eternal life, and so on.22",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=274

Christ to the man, which made sense against the Arian argument that 
the sufferings proved that Christ was not God, was no longer a helpful 
move once the question had shifted to defending the unity of Christ. The rhetorical balance of Augustine and Leo gave way to an asymmet-
rical Christology in which the Word was clearly the subject of all 
Christ’s actions. When the Scythian monks offered their own “rule,” they tellingly 
drew on a statement from Gregory of Nazianzus, not from Augustine. The rule from Gregory, as the Scythian monks cited it, reads, “I ad-
monish you . . . that you indeed ascribe the higher things to the divinity 
and to that nature which is proven superior to passions and the body, 
but you attribute the lower things to the composite who for you emp-
tied himself and was incarnate.”23 The Scythian monks cited this pas-
sage in support of their contention that after the incarnation, the Word 
was “composite.” However, it is important to note that Gregory was 
not making a distinction between the divine and human natures of 
Christ, attributing higher things to the ﬁ rst and lower things to the

the distinction between the two natures, which could sometimes be 
read as a distinction between two subjects, was often replaced by a dis-
tinction between the Word (considered apart from the incarnation) 
and the Word incarnate. This latter distinction more clearly kept the 
Word the subject of both the miracles and the sufferings. Why Christ Is Called God
Beyond the issue of rhetorical balance, one may detect in Augustine’s 
Christology in De Trinitate another element that resonated uncomfort-
ably with the opponents of the Scythian monks. This element con-
cerned the basis on which Christ was asserted to be God. Augustine 
stated, in the passage already quoted above, “Because the form of God 
took on the form of a servant, each is God and each is man, but each is 
God because of God taking on, and each is man because of man taken 
on [acceptum hominem].”24 Here, the man Christ was called God be-
cause it was God who assumed him. In John Maxentius’s Dialogue against the Nestorians, a similar posi-
tion was put into the mouth of the character Nestorianus, who repre-
sented the position of the papal legates to Constantinople with whom 
the Scythian monks clashed. In a discussion of the term theotokos, Nes-
torianus stated, “Although I will not hesitate to confess the blessed vir-
gin to be theotokos, I confess her to be theotokos not because she bore 
God, but because she bore a man united to God.”",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=276

gin to be theotokos, I confess her to be theotokos not because she bore 
God, but because she bore a man united to God.” When Catholicus, the 
character who represented John Maxentius’s position, asked why Nes-
torianus called her theotokos if she bore a man and not God, Nestori-
anus explained himself by saying that the one born of Mary is called 
God “by the uniting.”25 In the mind of John Maxentius, to say that the 
man was called God because he was united to God was tantamount to 
saying that he was called God merely as a title of dignity or honor. 26 In 
other words, an appeal to the uniting of God and man as an explanation 
of why the man deserved to be called God failed to recognize that the 
word “man” actually referred to the Word and not to an independent

human subject. With that failure, the confession of the theotokos was 
compromised. In Augustine’s context, the statement that the man Christ is God 
because God assumed him was nothing more than an appeal to Christ’s 
unchanging divine nature as the basis for calling him God, without any 
reﬂ ection on the theotokos or the mode of union. John Maxentius, on the 
other hand, laid out the alternatives in the Dialogue against the Nestori-
ans as follows: Christ is either God by nature or God by uniting. This 
was a way of framing the question that Augustine did not have in mind, 
and it presented a range of possible answers from which Augustine was 
not attempting to choose. Yet, when one attempts to read Augustine’s 
formulations as an answer to the questions framed by John Maxentius, 
at least some of those formulations come out sounding uncomfortably 
close to the position of the character Nestorianus. Augustine’s View of the Incarnation as Grace

A unique element of Augustine’s Christology was his argument that 
the incarnation itself was the premier example of God’s grace. This 
point, however, also underwent a transformation when Augustine was 
read by those in the sixth century who were attempting to describe the 
mode of the union of Christ’s two natures. Therefore, I will ﬁ rst set Au-
gustine’s argument in its own context and then proceed to describe the 
sixth-century transformation of that context. Augustine’s christological discussion in the Enchiridion took place 
in dialogue most prominently with the Pelagians. Against the Pelagian 
assertion that salvation was a response on the part of God to human 
merit, Augustine held up the incarnation as the premier example of 
grace. “What did the human nature in the man Christ merit,” Augus-
tine asked, “that it might be assumed singularly into the unity of person 
of the only Son of God?”27 For Augustine, Christ’s lack of prevenient 
human merit set the pattern for salvation by grace apart from pre-
venient merit for human beings in general. Such glory belonged to 
human nature without preceding merit, according to Augustine, “so 
that people may understand that they are justiﬁ ed from sins by the
222 David R. Maxwell
same grace by which it came about that the man Christ could have no 
sin . . . .”28 
In De praedestinatione sanctorum, Augustine made the same move 
for the issue of predestination. There he called Christ “the most bril-
liant light of predestination and grace.”29 Augustine developed his ar-
gument in more detail by appealing to the scriptural image of Christ 
being the head and the church being his body. Since Christ is the head, 
he is the source of grace, but the same grace applies both to the head and 
the body.30 One might get the impression from Augustine’s language about 
the man Christ being joined to the Word that Augustine subscribed to 
some sort of adoptionist theory, in which a preexistent human being 
later becomes Christ. Augustine was aware of this possible misinterpre-
tation and clariﬁ ed his position in a number of places to exclude it. Au-
gustine held that the creation of the man and the grace of union were 
coterminous.31 This fact actually served to strengthen Augustine’s ar-
gument.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=278

gustine held that the creation of the man and the grace of union were 
coterminous.31 This fact actually served to strengthen Augustine’s ar-
gument. Since there was no man Christ before the grace of his assump-
tion by the Word, any talk of prevenient merit bringing about that 
assumption would be nonsense. Like Augustine’s discussion in the Enchiridion, his argument in De 
praedestinatione sanctorum described the incarnation as a grace not in re-
sponse to a dispute about the mode of union of the two natures, but 
rather in response to a dispute about the role of merit in human salva-
tion. Augustine’s main point with respect to the category of grace in 
Christology was to maintain God’s initiative and execution of the plan 
of salvation by excluding prevenient human merit not only from Chris-
tology but also from every human conversion. Because the Scythian monks also argued in an anti-Pelagian con-
text, one might expect that Augustine’s assertion that the incarnation 
was a paradigm of grace would be ready-made for the Scythian monks 
to use against their opponents. The Scythian monks, however, never 
used this argument. The most likely explanation for this lacuna, it 
seems to me, is that the Scythian monks, in addition to their opposition 
to the semi-Pelagians, were also very much focused on the question of 
the mode of union. They scrupulously avoided all language of grace in 
their descriptions of the incarnation. In fact, they explicitly rejected the 
idea that the uniting of the two natures was secundum gratiam. They

listed this error along with the following erroneous notions of union: 
“according to affect or grace or dignity or equal honor or authority, or 
according to name or concord or illustration, or according to interior 
operation or personal uniting.” Instead of these errors, they wished to 
afﬁ rm, with Cyril of Alexandria’s third anathema, a “natural union” 
and, with Gregory of Nazianzus’s Epistle to Cledonium, that the uniting 
took place substantialiter.32 According to the way the Scythian monks 
framed the issues, there were two basic christological positions: the 
uniting of the two natures occurred either by grace or by nature. If by 
grace, then there really was no union at all. If by nature, then there was 
truly one person, whom they identiﬁ ed as the Word. The Scythian monks found a different way of excluding merit 
from Christology.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=279

became Christ, Christ did not become God.33 For them, this guaranteed 
that merit has no place in Christology because it ruled out the position, 
which they attributed to their opponents, that Christ became God “by 
advancement, not by nature” (per provectum non per naturam).34 The 
suggestion here was that their opponents thought that the man some-
how merited becoming God. Even though the Scythian monks shared, then, Augustine’s ulti-
mate purpose to exclude prevenient merit both from the incarnation 
and from human salvation in general, Augustine’s way of making this 
case, by speaking of a role for grace in the incarnation, created a disso-
nance with the Christology of the Scythian monks because they were 
apt to understand assertions of christological grace to refer to the mode 
of union, a concern which Augustine in his original context was not 
primarily addressing. Conclusion In the anti-Nestorian context of the sixth-century Theopaschite contro-
versy, two concerns arose that distinguished this controversy from Au-
gustine’s original context. First, the Scythian monks were concerned to 
make the point that all Christ’s actions and experiences, especially his 
most humiliating one, the cruciﬁ xion, applied to “One of the Trinity,” 
that is, the Word. Second, the Scythian monks were concerned to show
224 David R. Maxwell
that the mode of the christological union was ontological rather than 
based on grace or good will. Augustine must have sounded Nestorian when he was read with 
these questions in mind. His interpretive rule expressed in De Trinitate, 
which was originally intended to defend the deity of Christ, in the new 
context sounded like it was designed to separate out Christ’s actions be-
tween two subjects. Second, his statement that Christ was called God 
because it was God who assumed him lacked the clarity that the Word 
was the only subject in Christ. Finally, his description of the role of 
grace in the incarnation, originally intended to exclude merit from 
Christology as well as soteriology, could have sounded like he was de-
scribing a mode of union based on good will rather than on an onto-
logical foundation.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=280

not to rely on Augustine as a primary authority for their christological 
position. Because the Scythian monks did not discuss these passages of 
Augustine, we cannot be certain whether they read them this way or 
whether they were sophisticated enough to place them in their original 
context. In any case, the problem was not Augustine himself, but the 
way his formulations could be interpreted in their new context. Re-
gardless of their commitment to Augustine, the Scythian monks simply 
could not afford to use quotations from him that appeared uncomfort-
ably close to what their opponents were saying. This historical example of the way in which theological formula-
tions change meanings when thrust into a new context has direct rele-
vance for the struggle over the course of the last century to classify 
Augustine as either “Antiochene” or “Alexandrian.”35 In order to claim 
Augustine for one side or the other, one must read Augustine as if 
he were addressing the questions posed by the controversy between 
these two schools of thought. 36 The example of how Augustine fared in 
the Theopaschite controversy, however, suggests that such a procedure 
 ultimately falsiﬁ es Augustine. Notes 1. Leo, Tome 4 (in T. Herbert Bindley, ed., The Oecumenical Documents of

The Persistence of Decay
Bodily Disintegration and Cyrillian Christology
John J. O’Keefe
I
n one of the most memorable scenes from Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s
 magisterial work The Brothers Karamazov, Alyosha’s mentor, the 
monk Zosima, dies. Because of his exemplary life, many in the monas-
tery and around the village in which the monastery is located expect 
that Zosima’s death will be accompanied by some kind of miracle. Per-
haps, some wonder publicly, he might even be one of those given the 
grace of incorruptibility, donning in death an even more public witness 
to the sanctity that he had exhibited in life. Scandalously, however, this 
is not to be: even before the prayers for the dead can be completed, the 
unmistakable odor of decay escapes from inside the dead monk’s cofﬁ n. 
Zosima’s “corruption” provokes feelings of bitter disappointment in his 
friends and quiet glee in those who disliked him. None of the observers 
exhibit indifference. When I read that passage for the ﬁ rst time in my late teens I knew 
nothing about theology, but unlike most Americans, who are insulated 
from decay, I knew something of corruption. When I was ten or eleven 
years old my family took a trip to St. Croix, in the United States Virgin

cokes and passing out surfboards. One morning a terrible stink was 
coming from the shack, and I watched my new friend look around for 
the source. After a few minutes he moved some objects and discovered 
a decomposing rat sitting on the shelf. The rat was oozing with mag-

the source. After a few minutes he moved some objects and discovered 
a decomposing rat sitting on the shelf. The rat was oozing with mag-
gots, and it was quickly returning to the dust of the earth. This was my 
ﬁ rst experience of “corruption.” Years later when I began my studies in patristics, I did not im-
mediately associate the word “corruption” (a standard translation of 
phthora) with the decay I had seen in the rat. To my untrained mind 
corruption meant moral turpitude, of the sort found in a “corrupt” cop 
or a “corrupt” politician. Certainly there are moral overtones in the 
meaning of phthora, but it would be erroneous to think that this was 
the primary meaning of the term in early Christian theological reﬂ ec-
tion. This fact has not been lost in modern Bible translation. Indeed, 
the loss of the sense of corruption as “decay” offers strong arguments 
for the translation of Romans 8:20–21 that appears in the new RSV: 
“for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the 
will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will 
be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the 
glory of the children of God.” This translation conveys the sense of 
physical decomposition far better than the English word “corruption.” Similarly, when Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15 with respect to the res-
urrection of the dead that “what is sown in corruption is raised in incor-
ruption,” he meant primarily decay and lack of decay and not moral 
failure. This may seem an odd way to begin an essay discussing later devel-
opments in the Christology of Cyril of Alexandria. However, such a 
beginning offers us the opportunity to explore a neglected side of the 
christological controversy. Elsewhere I have argued that in that debate 
Cyril advanced a christological argument that allowed him to maxi-
mize language defending the incarnation even when such language 
seemed to endanger a robust doctrine of divine impassibility.1 This con-
viction led him into direct conﬂ ict with Nestorius, who found Cyril’s 
emphasis on incarnation overly reckless and insufﬁ ciently attentive to 
the immutability of the divine nature. I do not wish to rehearse those

texts that highlight the identity of the Son of God and that attempt to 
explain how he could really become a ﬂ esh-and-blood human being 
without compromising his divinity, I focus on the human side of Cyril’s 
christological thinking. It was not, in my view, simply a conceptual 
puzzle that motivated Cyril’s efforts to defend the truth of God’s pres-
ence in Jesus. Rather, Christ gave hope that the human race would one 
day be able to escape from the violent force of bodily corruption, putre-
ﬁ cation, and decay. Attention to the problem of decay and corruption can help modern 
readers access that hope more concretely. It can also help students of 
classical Christology break free of the tendency to dismiss Alexandrian 
Christology as “high.” In contemporary theological discourse, high 
Christologies are thought to be “bad” because of their alleged inatten-
tion to experience and overemphasis on philosophical categories. We 
often fail fully to realize, however, that in making these distinctions we 
emphasize a particular kind of human experience over another. Mod-
ern low Christologies seek to emphasize the sacredness of the human 
here and now, as well as the way in which Christ sanctiﬁ ed human 
physical life as it is by means of his true humanness. Such an emphasis 
includes an eschatology that focuses on the realized elements of the 
Christian hope and, as such, ﬁ ts comfortably in the modern Western 
world, where material prosperity facilitates a more favorable assess-
ment of physical creation than was possible in the ancient world. There is no space here to offer a full evaluation of the cultural roots 
of a theological insistence on low Christology. However, we serve the 
ancient Christian past poorly if we claim that only a low Christology of 
the modern sort can access human desire and ﬂ ow from human experi-
ence. In fact, we have every reason to believe that ancient Alexandrian 
Christology was deeply and profoundly driven by particular human ex-
perience and particular human hopes. That these differed somewhat 
from our own should neither surprise nor scandalize us.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=287

major theme in Paul’s work. However, as with many passages in Scrip-
ture, some take on a life of their own in a surprising manner. A classic 
example is the preoccupation with Romans 7 that has heavily deter-
mined Western debates about human freedom and God’s grace. Simi-
larly, preoccupation with Paul’s reference to corruption and incorruption 
signiﬁ cantly inﬂ uenced the development of classical Christology in the 
patristic tradition. The context of this essay does not allow for a com-
prehensive survey of the patristic reception of Paul’s interest in incor-
ruption. However, since Cyril was heavily inﬂ uenced by Athanasius, 
and Athanasius in turn by Irenaeus,2 a brief consideration of the pres-
ence of this theme in Irenaeus and Athanasius will help us to under-
stand its impact on later christological thinking. Corruption in Irenaeus and Athanasius
In Irenaeus’s Against the Heresies, we frequently encounter the scandal 
of corruption. Signiﬁ cantly, references to the problem are not limited to 
Irenaeus’s discussion of Christ’s redemptive role. They also appear in 
the context of his discussion of the value systems of his Gnostic oppo-
nents. These, it would appear, were constructing their schemes of 
 salvation on the assumption that corruption was a human evil that 
could not be overcome because it was intrinsically linked to the world 
of  matter. According to Irenaeus, these individuals maintained that 
 matter “is incapable” of receiving the spiritual and that “it is impossible 
that spiritual substance should ever come under the power of corrup-
tion.”3 This Gnostic antithesis between spirit and matter is hardly sur-
prising, but the connection between Gnostic revulsion at material life 
and the reality of material decay is worth noting. Irenaeus certainly did 
so. Thus, in book 2, to cite another example, Gnostic views of salvation 
fall under scrutiny when they claim material substance falls “of neces-
sity” into corruption and that Jesus came to transfer humanity out of 
this corruption-prone materiality to a place of spirit.4",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=288

ously defended the resurrection of the body, the Gnostic revulsion at 
decay would not have stirred much debate. According to Caroline
232 John J. O’Keefe
Walker Bynum, “horror at decay”5 was a common sentiment. Citing a 
variety of ancient sources, Bynum captures some of the emotion that 
corruption and decay could arouse:
Body is worse than dung, asserted the pagan Celsus (quoting Hera-
clitus); it is “a disgusting vessel of urine” and “bag of shit,” said the 
Christian apologist Arnobius. It is perpetual mutation, explained 
the theologian Basil. It can be the food of ﬁ sh or carrion beasts or 
even of human beings, said Cyril of Jerusalem and Macarius (quot-
ing pagan objections); how then will it be reassembled? Who would 
want it back, asked Ambrose; it is only a wretched prison for the 
soul, which aches to escape from pain.6 Context could soften some of these judgments against bodily life, but 
probably not by very much. Bodily life was hard; according to historian 
Peter Brown,
[Ancient society] was more helplessly exposed to death than is even 
the most afﬂ icted underdeveloped country in the modern world. Citizens of the Roman Empire at its height, in the second century 
A.D., were born into the world with an average life expectancy of 
less than twenty-ﬁ ve years. Death fell savagely on the young. Those 
who survived childhood remained at risk. Only four out of every 
hundred men, and fewer women, lived beyond the age of ﬁ fty.7 In such a context of disgust, how can we account for the expectant 
optimism that accompanies the death of Dostoyevsky’s Zosima? Aly-
osha Karamazov and many others clearly expect that some form of mi-
raculous liberation from the bondage to decay will be materially visible 
on the body of the dead monk. They would not have been satisﬁ ed with 
an allegorical translation of “incorruption” into the language of the 
soul’s escape from material bondage.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=289

all for a miraculous sign of saintly incorruption derives, at least in part, 
from the ancient vision of Irenaeus and the Christology that ﬂ ows 
from it. While Irenaeus’s opponents may have been revolted by corruption 
and decay, Irenaeus himself made hope in its demise a centerpiece of his 
Christian vision. Nowhere is this more clear than in book 5 of Against 
the Heresies. Here, Irenaeus, like all of his contemporaries, defended the 
immortal character of the soul and recognized that the body is the as-
pect of human life that suffers from the sting of corruption. “For to 
die is to lose vital power,” Irenaeus writes, “and to become henceforth 
breathless, inanimate, and devoid of motion, and to melt away into 
those component parts from which also it derived the commencement 
of its substance.” This dissolution cannot happen to the soul, for it is 
“simple and not composite, so that it cannot be decomposed.”8 One might expect that with such a traditional sense of the soul’s 
immortality, Irenaeus would be tempted to reduce humanity to its soul-
ish character, but he does not. Instead, he argues forcefully that the full 
weight of biblical revelation points to a salvation that includes the com-
plete human, both the soul and the body. Indeed, it was the aim of sav-
ing physical creation itself, which includes humans with their bodies, 
that prompted the Son to become incarnate in the ﬁ rst place. For Ire-
naeus, when the Scriptures speak of death, “it is in reference to the 
ﬂ esh,” the very same ﬂ esh that Paul promised would be restored when 
he declared with respect to our bodies that they are “sown in corrup-
tion, but raised to incorruption.”9 This aspect of Irenaeus’s teaching is well known. However, we can 
still miss the existential force of his commitment to this position.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=290

still miss the existential force of his commitment to this position. Read-
ers of many works that describe Irenaeus’s impact are less likely to be 
reminded of it than of the fact that he developed the notions of “apos-
tolic succession” and “the rule of faith.” Irenaeus’s vision, however, 
reached far beyond his concerns about authority. Recall that one of the 
central tenets of the Gnostic worldview was revulsion at the idea of 
bodily life. Tertullian captures this sentiment well in his treatise On the 
Flesh of Christ. Reﬂ ecting upon what those with Gnostic sensibilities 
found unworthy in the idea of incarnation, he notes how much they 
hate the idea of the birth itself—“the ﬁ lth of the generative seeds within
234 John J. O’Keefe
the womb, of the bodily ﬂ uid and the blood; the loathsome, curdled 
lump of ﬂ esh which has to be fed for nine months off this same muck. ” 10 
Irenaeus shared Tertullian’s contempt for those who rejected Christ’s 
ﬂ esh, and we must understand that this contempt was rooted in a pro-
foundly different vision of what Christianity was about and of what 
Jesus had come to do. The resurrection of the body out of corruption into an incorrupt, 
restored creation deﬁ nes Irenaeus’s central concern far better than wor-
ries about authority. He says what he says about authority in order to 
protect his core vision. For “inasmuch as the opinions of certain persons 
are derived from heretical discourses, they are both ignorant of God’s 
dispensations, and of the mystery of the resurrection.” They know 
nothing of the “earthly kingdom which is the commencement of incor-
ruption” and in which the just will gradually take on characteristics of 
the divine nature. The resurrection of the dead will take place in the 
context of a creation renewed.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=291

the divine nature. The resurrection of the dead will take place in the 
context of a creation renewed. This will be “that very creation in which 
they toiled or were afﬂ icted, being proved in every way by suffering.”11 
According to Irenaeus, “neither is the substance nor the essence of the 
creation annihilated, for faithful and true is He who has established 
it.”12 Indeed, when this world ends, as Irenaeus explains at the conclu-
sion of his long book against the heresies, and all creation “ﬂ ourishes in 
an incorruptible state . . . there will be a new heaven and a new earth in 
which the new man will remain forever, always holding fresh converse 
with God.”13
Ireneaus’s eschatological vision bore the marks of a literal mille-
narianism that did not appeal to succeeding generations of Christian 
thinkers. The presence of this literalism has led some to pay insufﬁ cient 
attention to the central core of his vision and the impact that it would 
have on succeeding Christian generations who, like Alyosha, tried to 
give an account of the “hope that was in them.” However, if we pay at-
tention, we can discern the persistence of this theme in the emerging 
Greek tradition. Athanasius was clearly dismayed by the reality of death and decay. Because ancient writers generally do not reveal their inner feelings, it is 
dangerous to speculate about their motivations. However, to assume 
that the lack of explicit self-disclosure indicates an internalized ap-

atheia would seem to miss the mark. Athanasius’s On the Incarnation, 
although lacking ﬁ rst-person intimacy, displays considerable pathetic 
energy. We are surely not extracting more than that text can offer if we 
sense in chapter 6 a desperation at the human condition and a profound 
hopefulness in the face of God’s dramatic intervention: “the race of 
men was being destroyed, and man who was rational and who had 
been made in the image was being obliterated; and the work of God 
was perishing.” Indeed, Athanasius continues, “it would have been im-
proper that what had once been created rational and had partaken of 
his Word, should perish and return again to non-existence through 
 corruption. ”14

This text seems to anticipate the language of Saint Ignatius of 
 Loyola. Writing centuries later, he also meditated on the sorry state of 
the human race when he asked those making the spiritual exercises to 
contemplate “how the three divine persons looked at all the plain or 
 circuit of the world, full of men.” We should, he added, consider 
“how seeing that all were going down to hell,” the blessed Trinity de-
termined that “the Second Person shall become man and save the 
human race . . . .”15 Clearly, Ignatius lived in a vastly different age than 
Athanasius. He intended his Spiritual Exercises to move the heart and 
excite the retreatant to conversion. Athanasius’s world was different, 
but to the extent that we can assume a continuity of human experience, 
we do a disservice to our account of past theological reﬂ ection if we fail 
to consider the human side of the equation: theology is not always con-
structed upon calculated syllogisms and the rigid application of logic. Life and death, love and desire, joy and loss—all of these are intangible 
factors that drive and motivate, even if unseen and unarticulated. Thus, in a way, Athanasius’s sense of the pathos of corruptible hu-
manity inﬂ uenced his lifelong quest to ensure the full divinity of the 
Son of God. It would not be unfair to say that Athanasius, like Ire-
naeus, was obsessed with bodily survival. Chapter 8 of On the Incarna-
tion captures this. Because of the pervasive disease of human corruption, 
“the incorporeal and incorruptible and immaterial Word of God came 
to our realm.” He did this “because he saw that the rational race was 
perishing and that death was reigning over them through corruption.” Seeing this, God noted how improper such destruction was, and “he
236 John J. O’Keefe
had pity on our race, and was merciful to our inﬁ rmity, and submitted 
to our corruption, and did endure the dominion of death.” For this rea-
son, Athanasius explains further, “he took to himself a body, and that 
not foreign to our own.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=293

Studies of the development of doctrine tend to concentrate on the 
inadequacy of Athanasius’s christological imagery. Surely no Christol-
ogy that imagines Jesus as God wearing humanity as a slipcover can be 
adequate to the task of taking seriously the human dimension of the 
 incarnation. Defenders of modern ascending Christologies necessarily 
object. While these observations raise legitimate concerns, they can also 
deﬂ ect attention from the primary insight that Athanasius would have 
us grasp: corruption has grabbed, crippled, and devoured humanity, 
and only the invasions of God’s divinizing power can correct our inevi-
table slide into nothingness. Athanasius himself explains: And this he did in his loving kindness in order that, as all die in 
him, the law concerning corruption in men might be abolished—
since its power was concluded in the Lord’s body and it would 
never again have inﬂ uence over men who are like him—and in 
order that, as we had turned to corruption, he might turn them 
back again to incorruption and might give them life for death, in 
that he had made the body his own, and by the grace of the resur-
rection had rid them of death as straw is destroyed by ﬁ re.17
Such a transformation of human bodily existence could, in Athanasius’s 
view, be effected only by the radical invasion of divinity into the cre-
ation. Death, like some kind of personiﬁ ed demon, clung to human 
bodies and dragged them down to corruption. 18 In response, only God, 
who is life by nature, could cling to bodily nature and drag it up, as it 
were, to incorruption. Given this conviction about the human predicament and the divine 
cure, we should not be surprised at the energy with which Athanasius 
attacked the theology of Arius. A Son who is anything less than God 
could never hope to achieve this dramatically physical transformation 
in the human person. Far from evincing a revulsion at human bodily 
life, Athanasius’s defense of the Son’s complete divinity reveals his deep 
commitment to a vision of a humanity transformed. The Persistence of Decay 237

Corruption in Cyril of Alexandria If the Irenaean thread is present in Athanasius, can we say the same of 
Cyril of Alexandria? What, if any, are the clues that would indicate 
that the ﬁ fth-century patriarch of Alexandria conducted his own theo-
logical reﬂ ection with a similar revulsion at the destructive forces of 
corruption? This side of Cyril can be difﬁ cult to discover. Much of the 
academic discussion detailing his contribution has become entrenched 
in a distinction between Antiochene Christology and Alexandrian 
Christology, which depicts the Antiochene tradition as interested in the 
humanity of Jesus and the Alexandrian tradition as interested only in 
the divinity. Moreover, Cyril’s behavior as bishop irritated even his de-
fenders. The persecution of local Jews, his willingness to sanction vi-
olence against traditional temples, and his callous disregard for the lives 
of his opponents make efforts to describe him sympathetically seem im-
prudent at best and reckless at worst. The dark side of Cyril (like the dark side of Athanasius, or even the 
dark side of Augustine) certainly exists and should not be ignored in 
any comprehensive assessment of his contribution to the formation of 
ancient Christian theology. Yet, we should also take care that our at-
tention to his deﬁ cits not blind us from seeing his other side. If we are 
attentive we can discover the contours of a person with passionate con-
victions about the nature of God’s promise and the gift that Christ 
brings to the human race. Like Athanasius and virtually all patristic authors with the notable 
exception Augustine, Cyril does not directly reveal his inner world. We 
have no easy access to his hopes and fears or to his joys and sorrows, but 
we do have some access if we notice the clues. I have long been fasci-
nated by an obscure passage from Cyril’s Third Letter to Nestorius. After 
spending some time meditating on the divine origins of the Son and the 
sublime dignity of the Holy Spirit, Cyril abruptly shifts direction to the 
glories of the incarnation and the mystery of Mary, the mother of God. She is so named, not because the Son had a beginning in her womb, but 
because “he substantially united humanity with himself, and under-
went ﬂ eshly birth from her womb.” He did this “to bless the very origin 
of our existence.”",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=295

the curse on the whole race which dispatches our earthly bodies to 
death should cease as well as the words (from now on rendered 
null and void by him) “in sorrow you shall bear children” (Gen 
3:16), and he intended to prove true the prophet’s utterance, “Death 
waxed strong and swallowed and again God took away every tear 
from every countenance” (Isa 25:8). This is our reason for afﬁ rm-
ing of him that he personally blessed marriage by his Incarnation as 
well as by responding to the invitation to leave for Cana in Galilee 
along with the holy apostles. 19 In reading this passage, it would be tempting to dwell on possible 
insufﬁ ciencies in Cyril’s description of the relationship between the di-
vine and human natures in the one man Jesus. Alternatively, we could 
ponder the growing sophistication of Cyril’s concept of hypostatic 
union. In both cases we would be asking good questions. However, if 
we focus only on dominant melodies we may fail to hear signiﬁ cant 
descants. Clearly, Cyril developed a more sophisticated way to account for 
the union of humanity and divinity in Jesus as a result of Nestorius’s 
challenge to his less sophisticated early account. Yet, we cannot con-
clude that Nestorius’s challenge drove Cyril’s vision. That vision ex-
isted before any theological confrontation. In the passage cited above, 
we see it coming to the surface: we glimpse a primordial insight that the 
later theology was designed to defend, not the other way around. Con-
sider the close connection between the assertion of blessing on the ori-
gin of human existence—Christ’s incarnation in the womb of Mary as 
a human person—and the “curse . . . which dispatches our earthly bod-
ies to death.” Note how quickly this is followed by the quotations from 
Genesis and Isaiah emphasizing the invasion and removal of sorrow 
from the human condition. These sentiments reveal something about 
Cyril himself. Single instances rarely inspire trust, but this one does not stand 
alone. Such sentiments appear in Cyril’s writing well before the chris-
tological controversy.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=296

from the human condition. These sentiments reveal something about 
Cyril himself. Single instances rarely inspire trust, but this one does not stand 
alone. Such sentiments appear in Cyril’s writing well before the chris-
tological controversy. For example, in the Commentary on John, possibly 
one of Cyril’s earliest works,20 we encounter the following, which is 
worth quoting at length:
The Persistence of Decay 239 It was not otherwise possible for man, being of a nature which per-
ishes, to escape death, unless he recovered that ancient grace, and 
partook once more of God who holds all things together in being 
and preserves them in life through the Son and the Spirit. There-
fore, his only-begotten Word has become a partaker of ﬂ esh and 
blood (Heb 2:14), that is, he has become man, though being life by 
nature, and begotten of the life that is by nature, that is, of God 
the Father, so that, having united himself with the ﬂ esh which per-
ishes according to the law of its own nature . . . he might restore 
it to his own life and render it through himself a partaker of God 
the Father . . . . And he wears our nature, refashioning it to his own 
life. 21 The extent to which Cyril’s vision of salvation depends upon an appro-
priation of divine life made possible by the Son’s incarnation has been 
documented in an excellent study by Daniel Keating. 22 This particular 
passage from the Commentary on John aptly captures this dimension of 
Cyril’s understanding. Human beings are born with a corruptible 
 nature—“a nature which perishes.” Only the intervention of a nature 
that does not perish is sufﬁ ciently powerful to alter our trajectory to-
ward dissolution. We should not be confused here: Cyril, like Athana-
sius, and, more remotely, Irenaeus, was not thinking about perishing in 
an amorphous moral sense. To perish meant to succumb to decay. Keeping this in mind helps to contextualize some of Cyril’s re-
marks that could lead one to think that in his theology the humanity of 
Jesus was a ruse. For example, in his Dialogues on the Trinity, Cyril fre-
quently explains that the nature of the Son is far from those beings on 
earth who are subject to corruption. 23 Reading these passages without 
due reference to the soteriological implications fundamentally distorts 
Cyril’s point. The incorruptibility of the Son is necessary to ensure the 
transformation of the person from corruption to incorruption. Further 
passages in the dialogues make this connection explicit: the Son “as-
cended after having destroyed the bonds of death.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=297

240 John J. O’Keefe
Cyril’s approach can also clearly be seen in his famous dialogue 
That Christ Is One. To cite an example, Cyril is eager to show that the 
Son’s incarnation must be taken literally. He argues against those who 
claim that we should take this language metaphorically. When Paul in 
Galatians and 2 Corinthians asserts that Jesus became a “curse” and 
“sin” for us, they maintain, he clearly did not mean this literally; it has 
to do with Christ’s power to undo the curse and to undo sin. So also, 
they say, language about the Word becoming ﬂ esh should not be taken 
literally. Cyril’s response is instructive: In that case, if it is true that the Word became ﬂ esh in exactly the 
same way that he became curse and sin, which is how they under-
stand it, then surely he must have become ﬂ esh for the suppression 
of ﬂ esh? But how would this serve to exhibit the incorruptibility 
and imperishability of ﬂ esh which he achieved, ﬁ rst of all in his 
own body? For he did not allow it to remain mortal and subject to 
corruption, thus allowing the penalty of Adam’s transgression to 
continue to pass on to us, but since it was his own and personal 
ﬂ esh, that of the incorruptible God, he set it beyond death and cor-
ruption. 25 These sentiments appear throughout the text, and, when observed in 
their soteriological context, they offer evidence against an easy char-
acterization of Cyril’s Christology as hopelessly naive about Christ’s 
 humanity. Christ’s divine humanity transforms our corruption into 
his incorruption. Incorruption is the true, intended form of human 
 nature. Cyril’s commentaries were, of course, directed to a fairly sophisti-
cated audience. However, we can also observe similar themes permeat-
ing ofﬁ cial patriarchal messages directed to his entire ﬂ ock. The Festal 
Letters provide the best vantage point from which to observe this in ac-

ing ofﬁ cial patriarchal messages directed to his entire ﬂ ock. The Festal

posed a festal letter whose primary purpose was to announce the date of 
Easter and the beginning of Lent. These letters also provided him with 
the opportunity to reﬂ ect pastorally on the state of his diocese. Fortu-
nately for those who study Cyril, we possess letters from nearly every
The Persistence of Decay 241
year of his episcopacy. In these letters the themes of corruption and 
 deliverance from corruption make frequent appearances. Particularly 
striking is a text from Letter 5, written in preparation for Easter 
of 417: What is it, then, that makes this joyful noise so timely and decides 
that we must exult and lift up to the Savior his death as something 
sacred? I know that you know, but I will explain it anyway. Death 
has been conquered, which refused to be conquered. Corruption 
has been made new. Invincible suffering has been destroyed. Hell, 
stricken with insatiable greed, and never satisﬁ ed with those who 
had died, has learned, all unwillingly, what it could not bear to 
learn earlier. For it does not strive to get hold of those who are still 
falling, but has already disgorged those already taken, having suf-
fered a wonderful desolation by the Savior’s power. For he paid it a 
visit with the words, “Come out! You in the darkness, show your-
selves!” And having made his proclamation to the spirits in hell, 
who had once disobeyed, he ascended victorious, having raised up 
his own temple as a kind of ﬁ rst-fruits of our hope, made resurrec-
tion from the dead a way on which nature can travel, and per-
formed for us other good things as well. 26 The rhetorical juxtaposition of contrasting themes evokes strong emo-
tions: death is conquered; corruption is made new; the invincible is de-
stroyed; hell the desolator is desolated. Those who heard Cyril’s words 
would recognize the experience that they evoke and relish the hope 
that they offered. Christological explanations of the mechanism by 
which death is desolated are, in many ways, secondary to the profound 
human experience that drives them. Similar examples in the festal letter are not difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd. Let-

on corruption and resurrection in conjunction with an interpretation of 
the deeper meaning of “manna from heaven.” “After shaking off the 
corruption dwelling in our bodies,” he notes, paraphrasing Paul, “we
242 John J. O’Keefe
will put on instead the glory of incorruptibility.” This will not happen 
by denying our physical human nature; rather, it will be in a “refash-
ioning” that captures the “honor of incorruptibility.” This truth about 
our transformation, Cyril argues, is rooted in the Scriptures themselves 
and not just in Paul. The story in Exodus 16 about the manna from 
heaven functions as a type of the resurrected body. Cyril notes that 
when the Israelites tried to keep the manna overnight for themselves 
(Exod 16:20), it became corrupted, according to its nature. However, 
when God commanded that some be kept as an example for future 
generations (Exod 16:33–34), it was not corrupted because it was placed 
in God’s presence. “That this is what will happen to us too I think no 
one will doubt.” When Christ places us “in the presence of God the Fa-
ther,” our bodies will become incorruptible. “For we will no longer be 
subject to corruption, but rather will remain forever. The manna was 
taken as an example of this reality.” This reﬂ ection on the transforming 
power of God, typiﬁ ed in the manna, leads Cyril to an immediate re-
ﬂ ection on the signiﬁ cance of the incarnation: Let us reﬂ ect, then, that being by nature God, since he even ap-
peared from God, shining forth ineffably and incomprehensibly 
from God the Father’s very substance, he is for this reason quite 
reasonably regarded as completely in his form and in equality with 
him, as is in fact true; and yet “he humbled himself,” as scripture 
says, “taking the form of a slave” (Phil 2:7) and becoming as we 
are, that we might become as he is, refashioned by the activity of 
the Spirit into his likeness by grace.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=300

a human being like us because of us; but he is God because of him-
self and the one who begot him, both before the Incarnation and 
when he became a human being. For it was not possible that he 
who is from God by nature should not be God, even if “he became 
ﬂ esh,” as John says (Jn 1:14).27 In this text we can easily discern some of the passages from the 
New Testament that Cyril uses most frequently in the articulation of 
his Christology. 28 However, it is worth emphasizing that Cyril quoted 
these texts not as part of some abstract argument about the divine na-
The Persistence of Decay 243
ture of the Son of God. Rather, they appear in a pastoral letter and func-
tion to build up the hope of his hearers that death will not have the ﬁ nal 
word. In other words, a human experience drives his insight, the human 
experience of death and dissolution. Conclusion More examples could be assembled to support the point I have been 
emphasizing in this essay. However, these here should sufﬁ ce to show 
the extent to which easy dismissals of Cyril’s (or Athanasius’s) Christol-
ogy as irredeemably “high” miss the human realities that motivated its 
development and articulation. Alexandrian Christology may not em-
body contemporary sensibilities about the value of ordinary human life 
and subjective human experience, but it does embody actual sensibili-
ties about actual human lives. We should recall that this ancient Alex-
andrian diagnosis of the human problem, along with the prescribed 
cure, had tremendous staying power in the subsequent Christian tradi-
tion. Indeed, in the nineteenth century it was still actively ﬁ ring the

Mystery or Conundrum? The Apprehension of Christ in the Chalcedonian Deﬁ nition
John A. McGuckin I 
remember once, in an interdisciplinary meeting of university profes-
 sors and graduate students, mainly from Classics and Religion, the 
sardonic remark that New Testament “types”1 had so trampled their 
small number of texts into the ground, with such vast tonnage of com-
mentary compressing them into an impenetrable density, that any hope 
for a sensible future of exegesis seemed ill-grounded. I cannot remem-
ber a satisfying answer being returned on the occasion. Chalcedon 
seems, in many respects, a similar battleground for patristic “types.” Hardly anyone can be found who has not something to say on the sub-
ject, in and outside the discipline. A serious Chalcedonian bibliography 
would need an industrial truck to move it around campus, even if one 
ignored the near-inﬁ nite number of books that had at least a passing 
pundit’s reference to that council. One is reminded of Gregory of Nyssa 
trying to concentrate while his bath attendant (so he complains) insisted 
on telling him the ins and outs of trinitarian perichoresis.2 (That, inci-
dentally, must be the most well-repeated aphorism about patristics of 
the modern age, apart from Origen’s alleged self-castration, which was 
246
Mystery or Conundrum? 247
highly unlikely). Most have taken Gregory’s complaint at face value, 
smiling at the presumptuousness of a water-boiler instructing one of 
the most learned men of his generation, and smiling too at the class-ism 
of the Cappadocian bishop. But we moderns ought not to presume we 
understand all the ramiﬁ cations of his joke, nor feel smug in a puta-
tively class-less superiority, especially when we consider that his great-
est opponents in the city where he was hoping to have his bath were 
Aetios (a former repairer of water boilers) and Eunomius (who had just 
presided over the canonization of Aetios as a thaumaturg, while de-
nouncing Basil, Gregory’s recently deceased brother, as a charlatan). Here, as is usually the case in all theological and historical writing, con-
text matters. Scores were being settled in the real world; people were 
being held to account.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=304

or the inﬁ nitely greater complexity of the Council of Chalcedon, with-
out the proper context one reads the various melodies as disastrously as 
a musician who accidentally inverts a medieval score that does not have 
give-away tails for the correct orientation of the notes. What Gregory 
meant, I propose, was not that the average person in Byzantium spent 
the day discoursing about theology (pace Yeats), but that the Neo- 
Arians had done their groundwork well, and he was signaling to his 
friends in advance that the outcome of the Council of Constantinople 
381 was far from secure, simply because Theodosius I was himself a 
Nicene. For its part, the message of Chalcedon has been decried by theolo-
gians of every stripe, as a prime example of mechanistic befuddlement, 
as a relic of patriarchal obscurantism, as a hopeless enmeshment in his-
torical compromising (thereby betraying an unconscious debt to the 
Chalcedonian fathers that immiscibility is a “consummation devoutly 
to be wished”). Harnack even called it “the bankruptcy of Greek theol-
ogy.” The loudest critics of all, however, often turn out to be those who 
have no Greek, sometimes no connection with the context, or even text, 
of Chalcedon itself, beyond the digests of the symbolic statement that 
are presented in standard history of doctrine textbooks, and mostly of

main before us as our historical record (and for several of us as the au-

of these aves rarae, and it is an honor to offer this brief essay as a fest-
schriftliche tribute to someone whose work has, across many years, illu-
minated all that to which he has turned his attention, especially the 
christological domain which has been such a focus of his labors. The Road to Chalcedon The enterprise of the Council of Chalcedon, considered for its theo-
logical purpose, can be brieﬂ y stated.3 At the time of the death of Theo-
dosius II,4 which precipitated the calling of a new synod, there was a 
widespread desire among the bishops to rein in what was seen as the 
atrocious high-handedness of Dioscorus, the bishop of Alexandria. Less 
enthusiasm was felt among the Eastern bishops to remedy the latter’s 
apparent disregard for the careful “ecumenical” dialogue that Cyril 
had agreed to (brokered by Proclus and the Constantinopolitan court) 
in the years after Ephesus I. That settlement, culminating in 433 in the 
Formula of Reunion,5 had come into crisis following the death of its 
chief negotiators: Cyril himself, Proclus of Constantinople, John of An-
tioch, and most recently Theodosius II. Only Theodoret (the probable 
author of the Formula) remained, which is why he was a special target 
for many in the conciliar proceedings in 449.6 Even before Ephesus II, 
that ecumenical settlement had always represented only a tentative 
peace.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=306

and Theodore of Mopsuestia, indicating that Theodore ought to be re-
garded as much a heretic as Nestorius. It did not need much of a per-
ceived slight to set the furor off all over again, and this was exactly what 
the trial of Eutyches provided, and why this apparently small incident

in turn set off the forest ﬁ res that led not only to Ephesus in 449, but 
Chalcedon in 451, and Constantinople II in 553. Eutyches was, by that stage, an old and revered archimandrite, 
protected by the grand chamberlain Chrysaphios and the emperor him-
self, but hated by empress Pulcheria, who was bent on the downfall of 
the powerful eunuch who had closed her out of state counsels. Pul-
cheria was thus more than happy to orchestrate the opposition to her 
brother’s religious policy, if by doing so she could diminish the political 
credibility of her rival7 and weaken the patronage the equally-despised 
Empress Eudoxia was exercising, at a distance, through her separate al-
liance with him. More Cyrilline than Cyril himself, Eutyches was a 
walking target for many powerful factions. It was he who had been the 
ﬁ rst to cast a stone in the old days, by raising complaints against the 
new archbishop, Nestorius, in 428, very shortly after the latter’s instal-
lation. Popular imagination too trustingly accepts Pope Leo’s caricature 
of him as a dim old man. Eutyches was far from that. But while his 
theological “extremism” was not necessarily popular in the Great City 
(and certainly not with the Syrians or Romans), many of the Greek 
bishops outside Egypt were as loathe to condemn him as they were to 
exonerate him. This is exactly why Flavian’s tepid censure of the old 
man at an internal synod in Constantinople brought down on his own 
head the wrath of Pope Leo. What the Romans were not aware of, 
or were perhaps choosing to ignore, was that the Greeks knew the 
situation had radically altered between the possibility of the Constanti-
nopolitan settlement of 433, and the realities operative on the eve of 
Chalcedon.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=307

councils at Ephesus in 449 and Chalcedon in 451 were deeply aware of 
the lively possibility of a major rift that threatened to tear the Eastern 
church into three parts, dividing all its patriarchates from each other: 
Syria, Constantinople, and Alexandria, together with the considerable 
territories each also represented. This is of course exactly what would 
happen in the Chalcedonian aftermath, though probably no one in their 
wildest imaginings then ever thought that a temporary incapacity to 
reconcile differences would endure into a schism that would last for a 
millennium and a half. Dioscorus’s excessively robust attempt to settle 
the matter as he thought Cyril would have done it, was both politically
250 John A. McGuckin
and theologically inept. His blatant siding with Eutyches, and his disre-
gard of the legitimate concerns of Syria and Rome, when added to his 
high-handed dealings at the synod of 449, were signiﬁ cant in pushing 
away chances at reconciliation. When the opportunity for a fresh consideration of the christologi-
cal problem presented itself, with Pulcheria and Marcian’s willingness 
to address the complaints of the papacy in late 450, the hearts of many 
of the Greek bishops must have sunk. It was not as if the Roman agenda 
was not already known. Leo had already sent the Tomus Ad Flavianum 
to be read out at Ephesus 449, and had been infuriated when Dioscorus 
had suppressed it. Battle lines had been drawn up very clearly. To most 
of the easterners the prospect was simply that of an all-out war between 
christological positions that had, by attrition, been hardening into a 
straightforward conﬂ ict over terminology understood in the narrowest 
of parameters. By “narrowest” I mean the entire dispute being focused 
on the question of a “one or the other” kind of answer to the question: 
“One nature or two natures after the Union?” European church history 
books have long been used to seeing this whole intellectual line of de-
velopment through the lens of the Western tradition, and in particular,

with the political and intellectual shenanigans of the Greeks. But this is 
a long-standing lens that is necessary to resist. Clear, Leo may well have 
been. Even admirable may have been the intent to impose a stark ma-
trix over the ins and outs of the christological puzzle: but the terms of 
the Roman settlement were, it could equally be argued, too abrupt, 
and too disconnected from the reality of the delicate ecumenical bal-
ance that constituted the affairs of the easterners in the mid-ﬁ fth cen-
tury. This is not to advocate fudge (as many an emperor and patriarch 
would do in the years after Chalcedon); it is rather to state that the 
 process of approaching a christological settlement in the Roman man-
ner gave too high a valency to logical clarity, over the more ancient pat-
terns of thinking that had gone on at the many former synodical 
processes of the Eastern church, always working on the principle that a 
conciliar gathering was not about forming new doctrine, simply about 
stating the basic parameters of the ancient doctrine in a suitably rever-
ential way that addressed new crises, through a pattern of already, 
 popularly validated doxological confession. Mystery or Conundrum? 251
The Spirit of the Creeds: A Thesis
I will return to this notion in due course. It concerns the ancient syn-
odical belief that the vox episcoporum in synodical assembly is a pro-
phetic one that restates the church’s doxological confession. The ﬁ rst 
recourse to synodical “statement” (we can think of the Councils of Ni-
caea I and Constantinople I as examples) elevated the Creed as the fun-
damental statement of faith, and did so insofar as it was understood as

gard Creeds today as doctrinal summaries, but they began life as litur-
gical prayers, and were still being used as such when they were admitted 
into the conciliar record (indeed this was the intent of Justinian when 
they were inserted into Eucharistic liturgy, as well as baptismal liturgy, 
after the sixth century). So when occasion demanded more precision, as 
at Nicaea, a baptismal prayer was brought forward, and a few clausulae 
were added to reﬁ ne it—but not to the extent that the prayer itself lost 
its primary status. The insistence was always retained: theological ar-
ticulation of the faith, at important synods, must needs be doxological. In short, what was required in times of crisis, by the assembled episco-
pate, was not the resolution of theological conundrums, but the restate-
ment of the soteriological mystery in doxological form that would 
provide the correct lens for approaching such problems. This is a criti-
cal point. For I would like to suggest the thesis subsequently, that this is 
exactly where Leo’s Dogmatic Epistle to Flavian (the Tome) falls short, 
and that it was for this reason (as well as reasons of politically wishing 
to avoid inﬂ aming antagonisms in the East) that most of the Chalcedo-
nian bishops at ﬁ rst were reluctant to admit it beyond the very broad 
acclamation, “Leo and Cyril think alike.” When pressed, by imperial 
authority, to a more exact statement, the long stalling arguments that 
took up the dogmatic sessions of Chalcedon were entirely about shift-
ing away from Leo’s terms until as much restatement and distance 
could be managed as possible. The eventual restatement of the Chalce-
donian symbolon is something that the easterners felt more at ease 
with—and this (not least) because it had more of the character of a dox-
ology than the Leonine Tome. 252 John A. McGuckin In its origins the christological controversy was largely about set-

vying structures of christological models such as synapheia, krasis, mixis, 
and henosis. We may now take all of these major shifts in terminology 
in our stride, but to have argued the way through the thicket of seman-
tic difﬁ culties of this order, with a terminology that was still in process 
of being created (and notions of personhood that had not yet existed in 
classical philosophy),8 is little short of miraculous. That such a wonder-
ful development and coherent progress toward international commu-
nion should be so strictly relegated to the question, “One nature or two 
natures after the union?” was a tragic eventuality, whose impact still re-
mains to damage the international communion of the Christians, and is

turgically, and spiritually, among churches who continually sense their 
common unity, while being perennially faced with doctrinal and juris-

“Sons” language, in the cause of international communion, and adopt 
the substance of the single-subject Christology which was increasingly 
emerging as the point of contention. By the end of his life, as instanced

in the Eranistes (by all accounts a serious and unremitting assault on Eu-
tyches’ position in theology), the same Theodoret who as a young man 
had expressed grave doubts about Cyril’s sanity, as well as his incipient 
Apollinarism, all because the Alexandrian had dared use the word “hy-
postasis,” was himself using hypostatic language as the powerful me-
dium of his message. What does this suggest? That the christological 
fault line between Alexandria and Syria was healing, if not healed, and 
would have merged in a generation or less—so long as precipitate ac-
tion had not been taken to press a point that perhaps did not need to be 
insisted on. What I mean to suggest here, of course, is that Chalcedon proved 
to be the last straw for many in the East, not because of the ongoing ar-

element had been stirred into the mix: precisely the narrowing of the

had expressed grave doubts about Cyril’s sanity, as well as his incipient 
Apollinarism, all because the Alexandrian had dared use the word “hy-
postasis,” was himself using hypostatic language as the powerful me-
dium of his message. What does this suggest? That the christological 
fault line between Alexandria and Syria was healing, if not healed, and 
would have merged in a generation or less—so long as precipitate ac-
tion had not been taken to press a point that perhaps did not need to be 
insisted on. What I mean to suggest here, of course, is that Chalcedon proved 
to be the last straw for many in the East, not because of the ongoing ar-
gument between the Syrians and the Alexandrians but because a new 
element had been stirred into the mix: precisely the narrowing of the 
question down to “One or two natures after the Union?” This focused 
all eyes on the interpretation of the concept of “nature” (physis, ousia, 
natura) in a way that brought with it also the unavoidable corollary that 
the Romans who pressed this agenda had to be listened to for what they 
had to say about that concept of “nature.” And they had a lot to say. Being an ancient tradition, they had much to quarry from, as they in-
stinctively reached back into their own comparatively isolated patterns 
of thought for a deﬁ nitive answer, instead of listening to the contempo-
rary debate as it had been unfolding in the rich decades from 431 to 452. This default mechanism of turning back to a distinctively Roman past 
(as opposed to being open to the more messy ecumenical consensus of 
all the traditions and languages of the East) was understandable, but 
fatal for the cause of unity. It was, after all, what Rome was famed for: 
a traditionalist and secure source of ancient practice. On this basis 
Rome had built up its large prestige in Christian antiquity. But its 
weakness was that when Leo quarried far and wide among the Latins 
for the sources of his Tome to Flavian9 he introduced into the debate a 
mechanistic, typically Latin, idea of person, that took its origins in the 
Latin language’s conception of person as “that factor which stands as 
possessor of a generic nature.” The highly practical language of the 
 Romans approached individual identity through the legal notion of 
possession.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=313

254 John A. McGuckin
remains in the Chalcedonian statement) is very good at conceiving “bal-
ances” and “delimitations” (the separate rights and characters of the 
two natures possessed by the Logos, for example), but is comparatively 
tone deaf to the central notion that had been driving the christological 
problem in the East—which was the way the natures mysteriously ran 
into consilience: the word “mysteriously” signifying here exactly what 
the ancients meant by it—sacramentally or salviﬁ cally. After the era of 
the Cappadocians, consilience into unity was the central issue of all 
Greek religious discourse on Christ, and this because that consilience 
was commonly regarded as the absolute paradigm of how the Word of 
God, within the great and sacred mystery of the incarnation, caught 
up the entirety of humanity’s “nature” and deiﬁ ed it; that is, how hu-
manity, through Christ, had a consilience into God; or put another 
way—how Christology functioned always as soteriology, if it was to be 
authentic. Possession was about something else: about keeping things intact. Consilience to union is about a view of natures as themselves ﬂ uidly ca-
pable of being reconﬁ gured. Cyril had deeply impressed this on most 
of Greek theology from decades before. His point was that the human 
nature of Jesus was not just common, unredeemed, human nature, or 
Adamic nature. It was the nature of a New Adam. The common spittle 
of this God-Man was sight-restoring. The “mere” human ﬂ esh of this 
God-Man was (eucharistically) life-endowing; the simple word of this 
God-Man was life-restorative (as in the Lazarus episode). As much as 
he was truly human, therefore, he was “New Creation humanity.” His 
own New Creation humanity. This was a dynamic notion that the 
Greeks wished to preserve, for it was at the heart of all they understood 
by the principles of incarnational soteriology.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=314

new theology, but old doxology that would illuminate new difﬁ culties. The imposition of Leo’s language, written from a different perspective 
that had no liturgical embeddedness in it at all, but was simply a cut-
and-paste job from the old and prestigious teachers of the Latin world, 
threw the Chalcedonian fathers slightly off balance, but did not derail 
them. They ultimately refused to make Leo’s language the sole out-
come of Chalcedon. This was not, as has sometimes been suggested, 
Greek hybris holding out against Roman stubbornness. I propose that it 
was traditional Greek elevation of liturgical doxology, over legal se-
mantic precision. Doxology and Chalcedon We thus end with the central terms of the Chalcedonian settlement. But instead of deconstructing the symbolon to see what its origins were, 
or to make some form of intellectual or literary “balance” between the 
clausulae (and how many commentators have simply presumed this 
was all about balance?), let us see what different perspective we gain if 
we isolate the doxological skeleton (just as the baptismal creed was the 
skeletal structure of Nicaea) from the occasional scholia that were felt to 
be necessary for this particular occasion (again by comparison to Ni-
caea, such as the Homoousion, or the intruded anathemata). This is, I 
suggest, what we get if we stop looking at the Chalcedonian marginal 
notes and look at the doxological core, the “Prayer to the Savior.” The prolegomena to the synodical statement (lines 1–35) describes 
a fundamentally important context that ought not to be excised as if it

precise christological settlement that was achieved at Ephesus I. The 
bishops quote both creeds (Nicaea and Constantinople) in full, and then 
go on (lines 87–100) to endorse the (Ephesine) christological Epistles of 
Cyril and the Tome to Flavian as authoritative writings, the one for re-
futing Nestorius, the other for censuring Eutyches. After that point it 
makes its ﬁ nal ekthesis in the words we know so well. In what follows

here, I have recast that symbolon, taking it out of the language of anath-
ema and restoring it to the doxological stasis from which it originated. Although they have said that their creed is no different from Nicaea or 
Constantinople, their utterance makes it slightly nuanced, nonetheless. In a positivist light it would run like this, with the issue of “two natures 
before and one after?” being the pivot of the confessional statement, 
and thus set in the doxology to hem it in and contextualize how to ex-
egete the question:
We believe in the single Son. We believe in the impassible deity of the Son. We believe that the Son does not mix up or confuse natures. We believe that the Son took up our form, as the form of a servant. We believe that there were not two natures before the Union, becoming a new nature after it. We believe what the Fathers believed. We believe in One Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. We believe that he is perfect in deity and humanity, truly God and Man. We believe that he has a rational soul and body. We believe that he is consubstantial with the Father in Godhead but consubstantial with us in humanity.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=316
317,"We believe that he is perfect in deity and humanity, truly God and Man. We believe that he has a rational soul and body. We believe that he is consubstantial with the Father in Godhead but consubstantial with us in humanity. We believe that the Son is like us in all things except sin.

prayer, afﬁ rmation, celebration of the good news of Christ, and to that 
extent evangelical confession. How startlingly different the Chalcedo-
nian formula appears in this guise (or rather, once its guise of anathema 
has been stripped off). It becomes more clear, I suggest, how the pa-
tristic enterprise was not to solve a christological puzzle, but to protect 
a salviﬁ c mystery, so that it might continue to evoke wonderment, and 
continue opening the doors of mystery to the faithful. In this light Harnack’s statement (that here we have the bank-
ruptcy of Greek theology), is patently fallacious. Even when pressed to 
the wall, the Greek fathers can rise, in the end, to sublime christological 
praise. Chalcedon is, then, not a silly conundrum, but rather the prayer-
ful celebration of the mystery of the Union—the soteriological reunion 
of God and his mortal creatures in the mystery of unity that Christ 
himself represents. Notes 1. Also worth noting here is the remarkable disconnection in the past

considering the theological statement that was expected from it, by making two 
very revealing canonical, that is judicial, decrees: one to rehabilitate Theodoret 
(deposed at Ephesus 449), and the other to depose Dioscorus himself, who had 
secured Theodoret’s deposition, bent as he was on the downfall of the only sur-
viving Syrian theologian of international weight. Dioscorus’s deposition at Chal-
cedon was ostensibly based on his behavior at Ephesus in 449, but the real motive 
was the more complex “clearing of the ground,” theologically speaking, that was 
needed to roll the clock back to the last settlement that included Antioch, Con-
stantinople, Rome, and Alexandria: and that was the one represented in the 
 Formula of Reunion. 7. When she assumed regnant power in 450 she solved the problem more

that ‘person’ was an accidental characteristic that did not illuminate the funda-
mental philosophical datum of the genus (physis) or nature (ousia). When Chris-
tian theologians at this period were speaking about the movement of the divine 
hypostasis into history, through the incarnation, and consequently elevating the 
idea of the Person of the God-man to center stage, metaphysically and anthro-
pologically, they effectively created an entirely different philosophical concept of 
Person as a substantive. This moment was an axis point of ancient thought, and

position of Tertullian as a source (Adv. Praxean 27.11) ought no longer to be 
 simply “presumed” (though it should not be entirely ruled out in my estimate). And one of the “unstated” or silent sources has to be the work of Cassian, whose

the transﬁ guration in sacred art are important and striking as well: 
one thinks of the apse of S. Apollinare in Classe in Ravenna, where the 
transﬁ guration is depicted symbolically as bordering on paradise; or the 
spare and arresting apse in the monastery of St. Catherine on Sinai, 
which has been so illuminatingly interpreted by Jas´ Elsner as the cul-
mination of a spiritual ascent modeled on that of Moses, who appears—
standing before the burning bush and receiving the Law in the cleft of 
a rock—in roundels on either side of the apse.6 Beneath this apse wor-
shipped John of Sinai, the author of the Ladder of Divine Ascent (hence 
called John Climacus), the most inﬂ uential work in the Byzantine mo-
nastic tradition. As John reaches the ﬁ nal step of the ladder, he says, 
with a plausible allusion to the mystery of Mount Tabor (maybe even an 
allusion to the depiction in the apse): And now, for the rest, after all that has been said, there remain 
these three, binding tightly and securing the bond of all: faith, 
hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love, for God is so called. But I, so far as I can understand, see one as a ray, one as light, one

Although Jesus was one, he had several aspects; and to those who 
saw him he did not appear alike to all. That he had many aspects is 
clear from the saying, “I am the way, the truth and the life,” (Jn 
14:6) and “I am the bread,” (Jn 6:35) and “I am the door,” (Jn 10:9) 
and countless other such sayings. Moreover, that his appearance 
was not just the same to those who saw him, but varied according 
to their individual capacity, will be clear to people who carefully 
consider why, when about to be transﬁ gured on the high moun-
tain, he did not take all his disciples, but only Peter, James, and 
John. For they alone had the capacity to see his glory at that time, 
and were able also to perceive Moses and Elias when they appeared 
in glory, and to hear them conversing together, and the voice from 
heaven out of the cloud.10 The emphasis on the way in which Christ appeared to different people 
in different forms, according to their spiritual aptitude, reﬂ ects Ori-
gen’s concern to make credible the idea of a ﬁ nite manifestation of the 
inﬁ nite: the inﬁ nite is manifest in manifold ways, and we can see this

Jesus. Eusebius’s reply is that the different forms in which Jesus ap-
peared during his earthly ministry belong to the past, while his present 
gloriﬁ ed form was preﬁ gured by the transﬁ guration, in which his ap-
pearance was so transformed that the apostles could not look upon him 
because of the splendor that, in its ineffability, surpasses the measure of 
any eye or ear and consequently cannot be depicted by lifeless colors 
and shades. 11 This letter is preserved because it was cited by the eighth-

both these traditions of interpreting the transﬁ guration. Until very re-
cently Maximus the Confessor was known, if at all, as the “Confessor,” 
the Eastern monk who in the seventh century, together with Pope Mar-
tin I, resisted the imperial policy of monothelitism, the last of the clas-
sical christological heresies, ultimately at the cost of his life. Over the 
last few decades—mainly as a result of the work of Hans Urs von Bal-
thasar, a Swiss Catholic, Polycarp Sherwood, an American Benedic-
tine, and Lars Thunberg, a Swedish Lutheran—a much fuller picture 
of Maximus has become known in the West. Maximus, born in 580, educated probably in Constantinople, and 
brieﬂ y a very senior civil servant in the early years of Herakleios’s reign, 
became a monk in his early thirties and remained one for the rest of his 
long life. Until he was drawn, with some reluctance, into theological 
controversy, all his works grew out of that vocation: his theological vi-
sion is grounded in his commitment to and understanding of the Chris-
tian life, lived in his case as a monk. We ﬁ nd Maximus’s reﬂ ections on the transﬁ guration in his writ-
ings composed long before the outbreak of the monothelite controversy. In fact, in his writings on Christology, the mystery of Christ that lies at 
the center of his reﬂ ections is not the transﬁ guration but rather the 
closely related mystery of the agony in the garden. Maximus turns to 
the transﬁ guration in three works that cannot be exactly dated, but that 
belong to the decade from the mid-620s to the mid-630s, During this 
period Maximus left his monastery on the Sea of Marmara, close to 
Constantinople, in ﬂ ight before the marauding troops of the Persians, 
and settled in North Africa, where he was to remain for ﬁ fteen years 
or so. The ﬁ rst treatment of the transﬁ guration is found in the second 
“century” of his Centuries on Theology and the Incarnation—“centuries” 
refers to a monastic genre in which thoughts, both theological and as-
cetical, were presented in brief paragraphs for meditation. At the end 
of II.13, Maximus introduces the transﬁ guration as God’s ﬁ nal mani-
festation in his own form. For, he says, there are differences among 
those who stand before the Lord, and the Lord appears in different 
forms “according to the measure of each person’s faith.”",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=324

the Transﬁ guration is a symbol of the spiritual life: at its foot the Lord
264 Andrew Louth
appears in the form of a servant, at its summit in the form of God, “the 
form in which he existed before the world came to be.” The meaning of 
the transﬁ guration is stated very brieﬂ y: the Lord’s face shines like the 
sun, and his garments appear white, “that is to say, the words of the 
Gospel will then be clear and distinct, with nothing concealed.” Maxi-
mus brieﬂ y comments on the signiﬁ cance of Moses and Elias—they sig-
nify the law and the prophets—and the three tents, in which Maximus 
sees a reference to the three stages of salvation: virtue, spiritual knowl-
edge, and theology, typiﬁ ed by Elias, Moses, and the Lord, respectively. The extent of Maximus’s debt to Origen here is unmistakable: note 
the emphasis on the chameleon-like nature of the Word made ﬂ esh, the 
way the garments of Christ symbolize the gospel, and the identiﬁ cation 
of Moses and Elias with the law and the prophets. 13 The three stages 
represented by virtue, knowledge, and theology are also found in 
 Origen. 14

transﬁ guration, however, we ﬁ nd something that we might even call 
original—not what one expects in Byzantine writers. Origenist themes 
are still developed, but we begin to hear Maximus’s own voice. The ﬁ rst of these attempts occurs in questions 191 and 192 of the

newly discovered Questions and Answers (Quaestiones et dubia, as its

ancy between the Gospels about when the transﬁ guration took place: 
whether after six days, as in Matthew and Mark, or after eight days, as 
in Luke. The six days, Maximus argues, indicate the six days of cre-
ation, so that “after six days” signiﬁ es passing beyond ta phainomena, 
the created order as it appears to our senses. Luke’s eight days, by con-
trast, include a beginning and an end: “the ﬁ rst day in which the Lord 
spoke and the last of the transﬁ guration.”16 But both ways of reckoning 
are taken up in the spiritual interpretation (kata tên theôrian), which 
Maximus presents as follows: Since the human being through transgression has been reduced to 
a state opposed to nature, it is necessary that one who wants to as-
cend by the Word to the mount of theology ﬁ rst, as it were on one 
day, passes beyond what is opposed to nature and, as it were in six

days, traverses nature and comes into a state beyond nature, that is 
the eighth, for this underlies time and characterizes the state that is 
to come. Here Maximus afﬁ rms one of the basic principles of his theology, 
namely, the integrity of the natural, which has been established by God: 
our normal state, fractured by the Fall, is unnatural, and redemption 
and asceticism are concerned to restore a natural state. After reﬂ ecting on the apostles Peter, James, and John, who signify 
the three virtues of faith, hope, and love, Maximus considers the trans-
ﬁ guration itself:
The Word leads those who possess faith, hope, and love up on to 
the mountain of theology and is transﬁ gured before them, so that

as it is interpreted by Gregory of Nyssa17 and especially by Dionysius 
the Areopagite in his Mystical Theology,18 as a symbol of the ascent of 
the soul to God. (In this, he follows the suggestion of the mosaics in the 
apse of the monastic church of the Monastery of the Burning Bush—as 
it was called in his day, now the Monastery of St. Catherine—on Mount 
Sinai, though there is no reason to suppose that Maximus ever saw these 
mosaics.) Both Gregory and Dionysius make the point that, as Moses 
ascends the mountain, he passes beyond afﬁ rming those images and 
concepts in which God is revealed—symbolized by the sounding of the 
trumpets and the light ﬂ ashing from the summit—and enters the dark 
cloud that shrouds the summit, where he can no longer see anything: 
this is a symbol that he can now only know God by rejecting what his

uses this language to describe the ascent of the Mount of the Transﬁ gu-
ration: one passes from saying things about God derived from our 
knowledge of the created order and of God’s revelation (“that he is 
holy, king, and suchlike”) and is led to the rejection of images and con-
cepts, and thus to silent wonder. In the blinding radiance of the divinity 
of the transﬁ gured Christ, manifest on Mount Tabor, the disciples are 
reduced to silence, the silence of apophatic acknowledgment of the 
transcendence of divinity. But when Maximus goes on to remark that “the face of the Word, 
that shone like the sun, is the characteristic hiddenness of his being,” I 
think we should pick up an allusion to something deeper. The Greek 
word I have translated as “face” (prosôpon) could equally well be trans-
lated “person,” and what Maximus is alluding to is the fact that the 
 radiant face of Christ reveals the divine person that He is: “the face 
of the Word . . . is the characteristic hiddenness of his being,” that is, of 
the being of God. The Council of Chalcedon in 451 had endorsed a 
deﬁ nition according to which, in the incarnate Christ, there are two 
 natures—the divine and the human—united in a single person. The 
ﬁ fth ecumenical council (of Constantinople, in 553) clariﬁ ed this by af-
ﬁ rming that that one person is divine, “one of the Trinity.”",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=328

that seems typical of Maximus, the precise words he uses allude to the 
exact distinctions of the Christology of the councils. But there is more; 
if, on the Mount of the Transﬁ guration, the blinding radiance of the 
face/person of the Word reveals the “characteristic hiddenness” of the 
being of God, then apophatic theology—the theology of denial—is our 
acknowledgment of the divinity of Christ. The language of apophatic 
and kataphatic theology is the language of Dionysius, but the use to 
which it is put, and thus the meaning, is Maximus’s own. For Diony-
sius, apophatic and kataphatic theologies spelt out the dialectic involved 
in our predicating attributes or names of God: the dialectic of afﬁ rma-
tion and denial steered a way between the twin errors of anthropomor-
phism and agnosticism in our attempt to say something about God. But 
for Maximus, the terminology of apophatic and kataphatic theology 
seems to be bound up with our confession of the union of divine and 
human natures in the single divine person of the incarnate Word: ac-
knowledgment of the divine radiance of the face of Christ draws us

into apophatic theology, since the dazzling radiance of the face of Christ 
is beyond afﬁ rmation and can only be regarded in silent—apophatic—
wonder. In Maximus’s novel use of Dionysius’s terminology of apo-
phatic and kataphatic theology, there is what I would like to call a 
“christological turn.” This is conﬁ rmed as Maximus considers Christ’s body and gar-
ments that became resplendently white in the transﬁ guration.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=329

phatic and kataphatic theology, there is what I would like to call a 
“christological turn.” This is conﬁ rmed as Maximus considers Christ’s body and gar-
ments that became resplendently white in the transﬁ guration. The body 
refers to the “substance of the virtues” and the garment to the words of 
Scripture, or to the works of the cosmos: the whiteness of the garments 
means that both the divine words of Scripture and the divine works in 
the cosmos become transparent to those who have ascended to contem-
plation of Christ, and their beauty is revealed. But to understand the 
words of Scripture and the works of the cosmos is precisely what is 
 involved in afﬁ rmative—kataphatic—theology. So while the face of 
Christ draws us into apophatic theology, the body and the garments of 
Christ speak of kataphatic theology. The “christological turn” means 
that the terminology of apophatic and kataphatic, formulated by Dio-
nysius to describe the dialectical nature of our knowledge of God, is 
 applied by Maximus to express the truth of the union of the divine 
and human natures in the divine person of the Son. The whole of our 
knowledge of God, therefore, is summed up in the apostles’ beholding 
of Christ on the Mount of the Transﬁ guration. Question 192 follows from this and considers the meaning of the 
three tents Peter thought should be set up.19 They signify—as in the 
Centuries on Theology and Incarnation—the three stages of the Christian 
life, only here Maximus uses the more traditional terminology for these 
stages that goes back to Evagrius, the late-fourth-century Origenist and 
theorist of the eremitical life of the Desert Fathers: namely, praktiké 
(the active life of ascetic struggle), physiké (contemplation of the natural 
order), and theologia (theology as contemplation of God). Elias corre-
sponds to praktiké, Moses to physiké, and the Lord himself to theologia.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=330

so; however, it is clear that this comment entails an understanding of 
the transﬁ guration as embracing the whole span of the Christian life. These two early questions are relatively brief, amounting to about 
two and a half pages. The Origenist background is evident, but two
268 Andrew Louth
factors are, I think, striking: ﬁ rst, the use of the terminology of the 
 developed Byzantine Christology of the sixth century set out in the de-
crees of the ﬁ fth ecumenical council, and, second, Maximus’s strikingly 
original use of the Dionysian distinction between apophatic and kata-
phatic theology in relation to our understanding of Christ. The apo-
phatic points to the person of Christ: it is in a personal relationship with 
the incarnate Word that God’s unknowability is not only registered but 
experienced. Origen had reconciled God’s ineffability with his mani-
festation in the incarnation by emphasizing the manifold ways in which 
the manifestation of God is apprehended, with the consequence, drawn 
explicitly by Eusebius in his letter to Constantia (quoted earlier) that 
the notion of the inexhaustibility of God rules out any true depiction of 
the Incarnate One. For Maximus, on the contrary, the ineffable, the in-
exhaustible, is actually found in the face-to-face, person-to-person ex-
perience disclosed by the incarnation. This “christological turn,” then, 
transforms the theology of negation: apophatic theology is an acknowl-
edgment of the overwhelming reality of the person of God, rather than 
a principle of denial that qualiﬁ es and limits our afﬁ rmation of the re-
vealed images and concepts of God.20 The ﬁ nal attempt of Maximus to expound the mystery of the trans-
ﬁ guration is found in the ﬁ fth and longest of his Ambigua, or Difﬁ cul-

ter of gravity of this long and fascinating question-and-answer passage.21 
The central thread of this “difﬁ culty” concerns what is meant by “pass-
ing over”—diabasis. Maximus tackles this question from a bewildering 
variety of perspectives, including a long list of examples from the Bible 
(mainly the Old Testament), culminating in the transﬁ guration. Maximus’s treatment of the transﬁ guration22 begins by focusing on 
the face of Christ: the natural focus in any icon of the transﬁ guration, 
or indeed any icon at all. This comes as no surprise after what we have 
already seen in the Questions and Answers. We know how much is con-
centrated in the image of the face of Christ, the prosôpon or (divine) 
 person of Christ. The radiance from the face signiﬁ es Christ’s divinity, 
and that divinity dazzles—it both reveals and blinds. Maximus then
From Doctrine of Christ to Icon of Christ 269
explains why he has evoked the transﬁ guration in Ambiguum 10: this 
“difﬁ culty” is concerned with diabasis (passing over), and in the trans-
ﬁ guration the disciples “passed over” from seeing Christ as “without 
form or beauty” (Isa 53:2) to seeing him as “fair with beauty beyond the 
sons of men” (Ps 44:3)—an Origenist theme we have already encoun-
tered. 23 Maximus interprets this as a passing over from understanding 
Christ primarily as the “Word made ﬂ esh” to understanding him as the

of the Johannine prologue to its beginning, so to speak.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=332

“One in the beginning, with God, and God”—a passage from the end

little more what was contained in a single brief allusion in the earlier 
Questions and Answers. He calls this “passing over” from the “Word 
made ﬂ esh” to the “Word, in the beginning, with God” a movement of 
apophasis, negation or denial, and this apophasis, he says, the disciples 
have learnt from—or perhaps better, experienced in  beholding—the 
blinding radiance of the face of the transﬁ gured Lord. He then moves 
on to interpret the whitened garment of Christ, which—as we saw in 
Questions and Answers—he takes as referring to the words of Scripture 
or to creation itself, and is led into a long digression in which he ex-
pounds the parallelism of Scripture and cosmos. The cosmos is like a 
book, and the Bible is like the cosmos: both consist of words, logoi, 
which, though diverse, when read with understanding form a single 
harmonious whole, the meaning of which is the mind of God Himself. Maximus insists very strongly on the absolute equivalence of the writ-
ten law and the natural law: the written law does not mark an advance 
on the natural law, it simply reveals what has been obscured as a result 
of the Fall. This idea of the cosmos and Scripture as mutually reﬂ ecting 
each other—an idea that extends both to what they mean and how we 
are to understand them—is central to Maximus’s thought: he returns to 
it in the introductory chapters of his Mys tagogia.24
Maximus then explores further the two sides of the transﬁ guration, 
symbolized by the two ﬁ gures who appeared with Jesus, Moses and 
Elias.25 He does so at length, in seventeen meditations.",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=333

harmonious whole, the meaning of which is the mind of God Himself. Maximus insists very strongly on the absolute equivalence of the writ-
ten law and the natural law: the written law does not mark an advance 
on the natural law, it simply reveals what has been obscured as a result 
of the Fall. This idea of the cosmos and Scripture as mutually reﬂ ecting 
each other—an idea that extends both to what they mean and how we 
are to understand them—is central to Maximus’s thought: he returns to 
it in the introductory chapters of his Mys tagogia.24
Maximus then explores further the two sides of the transﬁ guration, 
symbolized by the two ﬁ gures who appeared with Jesus, Moses and 
Elias.25 He does so at length, in seventeen meditations. Some of his dis-
cussion is already familiar, such as Moses and Elias symbolizing the law 
and the prophets, much of it is arcane and fascinating, but I shall skip 
everything save for a few points in the last six meditations. There is an
270 Andrew Louth
exposition of the difference between apophatic and kataphatic theol-
ogy, in very Dionysian terms. This is followed by what I have already 
called the “christological turn,” in which the distinction between apo-
phatic and kataphatic theology is focused on the person of Christ, the 
silent wonder of apophasis being a response to the dazzling radiance of 
Christ’s face. Here Maximus says that, through accepting a human 
form, the Word has become a “symbol of himself,” in order
through this manifestation of himself to lead to himself in his com-
plete and secret hiddenness the whole creation, and while he re-
mains quite unknown in his hidden, secret place beyond all things, 
unable to be known or understood by any being in any way what-
ever, out of his love for humankind he grants to human beings in-
timations of himself in the manifest divine works performed in the 
ﬂ esh. (Amb. 10.31c: PG 91.1165D–1168A) Note that what Christ grants to humankind he grants for the sake of 
the whole creation—a characteristically Maximian stress on the cosmic. The next meditation afﬁ rms the primacy of apophatic theology in chris-
tological terms: “the light from the face of the Lord, therefore, con-
quers the human blessedness of the apostles by a hidden apophatic 
theology” (Amb. 10.31d: PG 91.1168A).",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=334

plicitly expound kataphatic theology in terms of the cosmic dimension 
of the Word made ﬂ esh (Amb. 10.31 e–g: PG 91.1168B–D). In this Ambiguum, then, Maximus sees in the transﬁ guration a 
thoroughly Christocentric theology, a theology that leads to and from 
the person of Christ, and ﬁ nds in everything illumined by the uncre-
ated light of his radiance the revelation of Christ in nature and in Scrip-
ture. But it is also theology expressed in an icon, so to speak: it is a series 
of meditations on aspects of the mystery or picture contemplated, all 
held together by the central ﬁ gure of Christ. At the beginning of this essay, I pointed out that while the domi-
nant interpretation in the Eastern Christian tradition holds that the 
transﬁ guration is one of the most profound icons of Christ, an Ori-
genist interpretation used the transﬁ guration as prime evidence of the 
manifold forms taken by the incarnate Word, to show that there could 
now be no icon of Christ. When controversy eventually broke out in the

Byzantine world about the legitimacy of icons and their veneration, the 
letter written by the Origenist Eusebius to Constantine’s half-sister, 
Constantia, was cited as key evidence of patristic disapproval of icons 
by the iconoclasts. Maximus’s interpretation of the transﬁ guration shows, I think, that 
without denying the Origenist approach to this mystery, he sets it in a 
different context. The manifold manifestations of the ineffable God be-

more surely revealed in the dazzling radiance of the face, or divine per-
son, of Christ: beholding that, we pass beyond utterance and gaze in si-
lent wonder—we enter the realm of apophatic theology. This approach 
does not discard the icon as inadequate, but rather afﬁ rms its validity 
by underlining the central signiﬁ cance in theology of beholding, look-
ing, and contemplating. The “christological turn,” understood in this 
manner, effects a transition from the doctrine of Christ, carefully honed 
by the deﬁ nitions of the councils, to the icon of Christ, the symbol—in 
the fullest sense—of encounter with Christ, and in this transition the 
doctrine is not left behind. Far from it: rather, the carefully honed doc-
trine of Christ guides our understanding of the icon. If there is such a transference of the doctrine of Christ to the icon 
of Christ in the theology of St. Maximus, then we are well on the way 
to understanding why the icon was invested with such profound sig-
niﬁ cance by Byzantine Christians, and in particular, why the question 
of the icon, when it became a matter of controversy, was understood as 
a matter of precisely christological controversy. We cannot enter into 
this question now, but let me suggest two hints of the connections that

ﬁ guration in Ambiguum 10. There he says, and I quote more fully a 
statement quoted above:
For it was necessary,26 without any change in himself, to be created 
like us, accepting through his immeasurable love for humankind 
to become the type and symbol of himself, and from himself
272 Andrew Louth
 symbolically to represent himself, and through the manifestation 
of himself to lead to himself in his complete and secret hiddenness 
the whole creation . . . . (Amb. 10.31c: PG 91.1165D)27 In the incarnation, the Word became a “type and symbol of himself.” One can perhaps hear an echo of this phrase in one of the central icono-
phile arguments of St. Theodore of Stoudios, who, together with the 
deposed patriarch Nikephoros, became the most important champion 
of the veneration of the icons in the second period of iconoclasm in the 
ﬁ rst half of the ninth century. Theodore argues that, in the incarnation, 
Christ becomes “the archetype of his own image,” prototypos tês heautou 
eikonos. 28 It follows that it is not simply possible for there to be an image 
of Christ, and it is not simply possible for an artist to depict an image of 
Christ, through which Christ can be encountered and worshipped: be-
cause Christ is manifest in the incarnation as “the archetype of his own 
image,” acknowledgment of the incarnation actually makes necessary 
the making of images to continue the access to the archetype entailed in 
the incarnation. 29 The premise of Theodore’s argument is, it seems to 
me, provided by Maximus when he says that the Word became a “type 
and symbol of himself.” Another hint is found in Maximus’s use of studied ambiguity— 
almost a play on words—when referring to the prosôpon of Christ: ei-
ther “face” or “person.”",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=337

Christ, from which radiance ﬂ ows, we behold the person of the God-
head: that is why the radiance dazzles, and that is why apophatic the-
ology interprets the vision here. 30 Many years ago, in his Der Logos am 
Kreuz,31 Alois Grillmeier drew attention to the depiction of the cruci-
ﬁ ed Christ in the sixth-century Rabbula Gospels, where Christ is de-
picted on the cross with his eyes open. Grillmeier suggested (drawing, 
among other things, on the Physiologus, which mentions the legend that 
the lion sleeps with its eyes open and applies this to the idea of Christ 
as the “lion of Judah” [cf. Gen 49:9; Rev 5:5]) that the open eyes indicate 
the divinity of Christ awake, while the humanity of Christ submits to 
death.32 If the eyes make the face, then St. Maximus’s interpretation of 
the transﬁ guration is strikingly analogous to the iconography of the 
“Logos on the Cross.” From Doctrine of Christ to Icon of Christ 273
What we ﬁ nd, then, in Maximus’s attempts to unfold the meaning 
of the mystery of the transﬁ guration is a fascinating interweaving of a 
spiritual theme, a theological theme, and a philosophical theme. The 
spiritual theme treats the transﬁ guration as emblematic of the fullest 
possible human encounter with God; the theological theme is drawn 
from the councils of the church, where the technical language of the 
conciliar decrees suggests a bold interpretation of the radiant face of 
the transﬁ gured Christ; the philosophical theme, drawn from Diony-
sius the Areopagite, of the distinction between apophatic and kata-
phatic theology, is focused on the person of the Incarnate One. In the 
mutual illumination of these themes, there emerges the icon of Christ 
in whose contemplation is found the fullness of theology. Theology as 
doctrine draws those addressed into theology as contemplation: doc-
trine of Christ yields to contemplation of the icon or image of Christ. Notes",430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation$@$20250530_170954/430183501-Peter-W-Martens-Ed-in-the-Shadow-of-the-Incarnation.pdf#page=338
