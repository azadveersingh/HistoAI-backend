2 Introduction and Purpose of Architectural Design In natural language processing (NLP) and text summarization, the representation and manipulation of 
textual data through advanced graphical models have garnered significant attention. Semantic graphs 
play a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) by providing a structured representation of 
interconnected concepts and relationships, aiding in understanding human language (Bharambe et al. 
2022; Prasad et al. 2022). Knowledge graphs (KGs) have gained significant attention in academia and 
industry for their ability to represent semantic relations between entities, proving particularly relevant 
for NLP applications (Schneider et al., 2022). These graphs are powerful tools for managing big data, 
enabling tasks such as knowledge management, information discovery, semantic search, and content-
based recommendation systems (Prasad et al., 2022). These semantic hypergraphs are a powerful tool 
for encapsulating and summarizing the semantic content of large text datasets (Menezes and Roth, 
2019). Accurately measuring the similarity between conceptual graphs is crucial for various NLP tasks, 
including information retrieval and text clustering (Hui and Jianjun, 2018). An extension to 
accommodate graphs with unbounded node degrees is also proposed, expanding the applicability of 
DAG automata in processing complex graph structures (Chiang et al., 2018). In pursuit of advancing the field of intelligence extraction and visualization, we present an innovative 
methodology for construing and visualizing Knowledge Graphs from texts, incorporating redirection 
capabilities. Our approach leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the 
LLM to manage and interpret text from documents, ensuring comprehensive understanding and 
organization of information. A critical component of this research is the construction of semantic graphs 
from the dependency parsing of individual sentences. As depicted in Figure 1, our framework comprises 
multi-tiered tiers: robust text extraction from multi-format inputs (PDF, DOCX, TXT), segmentation of 
text into manageable chunks, and the analysis of these chunks using the LLM to identify key concepts 
and their semantic relationships. We integrate semantic and contextual relationships into a 
comprehensive Knowledge Graph by concatenating data frames and enhancing the data frame with 
URLs linking to specific pages within the original multi-format inputs. This enables direct access to the 
source material. This multi-tiered methodology automates knowledge extraction and organization, 
enriches the Knowledge Graph with detailed relationships, and provides interactive features, 
representing a significant advancement in the field and a powerful tool for researchers, analysts, and 
knowledge workers. Future enhancements will explore integrating additional data sources and 
expanding interactive features for more sophisticated queries and analyses.",Big_data-guided_Knowledge_Graph_and_its_Visualization_from_Multi-$@$20250530_171258/Big_data-guided_Knowledge_Graph_and_its_Visualization_from_Multi-.pdf#page=2

the text as directed graphs, providing a robust framework for data mining tasks such as exploratory data

3 analysis, data description, and summarization (Rusu et al. 2009a; Rusu, 2009b). This technique 
leverages natural language processing (NLP) to transform textual data into a structured format that can 
be more easily analyzed and understood (Rusu et al. 2009). Despite the advantages, constructing and 
visualizing semantic graphs from PDF texts presents several challenges. These challenges stem from the 
inherent complexity of natural language, the need for accurate entity extraction, and the preservation of 
semantic relationships in lower-dimensional spaces. Various methods have been proposed to address 
these issues. For instance, the Semaphore model introduces an unsupervised probabilistic approach that 
aims to maintain the manifold structure through neighbourhood regularization, which enhances the 
quality of semantic visualizations (Le and Lauw, 2016). Additionally, the Doc2SoarGraph framework by (Zhu et al., 2023) integrates discrete reasoning 
capabilities to manage the differences and correlations among various document elements effectively. Moreover, Graph Style Sheets have been developed to facilitate filtering, grouping, and styling 
information elements through declarative transformation rules (Pietriga, 2006). These advancements 
contribute to the effectiveness of semantic graphs in various applications, including the Semantic 
Publishing Challenge, where text segmentation and entity extraction workflows are critical for linking 
detected entities to resources in existing open datasets (Sateli and Witte, 2015). Significance and Motivation of the Architectural Design

Various techniques for visualizing semantic graphs have been explored in the literature. One approach 
involves using tools and platforms designed explicitly for visualizing semantic web data, aiding in better 
understanding and analysis (Gupta and Malik, 2022). Another technique focuses on creating abstract 
semantic graphs highlighting path patterns and catering to users who need a deep understanding of the 
graph’s structure (Leal, 2018). A novel Graph-based visual semantic entanglement Network has also 
been proposed to model visual features through a knowledge graph, outperforming existing methods in 
zero-shot learning tasks (Hu et al., 2020). These techniques offer diverse advantages, such as improved 
analysis, path pattern highlighting, and enhanced semantic modelling. Yet, they also come with 
limitations like complexity in visualization and potential trade-offs in displaying detailed content versus 
structural insights. Semantic graphs have shown significant potential impact across healthcare, finance, 
and marketing industries. In healthcare, semantic data integration using knowledge graphs aids in 
interrelating medical ontologies for disease prediction systems (Maghawry et al., 2023). This integration 
provides a reliable knowledge base visualization for intelligent healthcare systems, enhancing the 
analysis of therapeutic interventions. Besides, in the marketing sector, semantic graphs facilitate data 
transformation in motion, allowing for missing node predictions through machine learning and graph 
algorithms (Reimer, 2022). Semantic graphs present a dynamic and efficient approach to managing text 
data in various industries, leading to improved decision-making and problem-solving capabilities. Evaluating redirecting capabilities in enhancing the visualization of complex semantic graphs is crucial 
for improving layout quality and performance. Various force-directed algorithms are utilized for 
visualizing graphs, focusing on mitigating challenges related to scalability and performance (Cheong and 
Si, 2018; Hussain et al., 2014).",Big_data-guided_Knowledge_Graph_and_its_Visualization_from_Multi-$@$20250530_171258/Big_data-guided_Knowledge_Graph_and_its_Visualization_from_Multi-.pdf#page=4

emphasizing power nodes, establishing local neighbourhood clusters, and applying semantic filtration 
to avoid cluttered views (Hussain et al., 2014). By considering these factors, researchers can assess the 
effectiveness of redirection capabilities in improving the visualization of intricate semantic graphs. Future developments in natural language processing (NLP) are poised to integrate redirecting 
capabilities for semantic graph visualization, enhancing tasks like semantic parsing and information 
retrieval (Collarana, 2017). By leveraging semantic graphs, NLP systems can optimize various tasks, 
improve search functionalities, and enable a deeper understanding of human language through 
ontologies (Bharambe et al., 2022). The integration of redirecting capabilities will allow for more 
interactive and dynamic visualization of semantic graphs, aiding in tasks like compositional 
generalization and weakly-supervised learning in semantic parsing (Petit and Corro, 2023). This 
advancement will enable users to interact with and explore complex semantic structures more

4 intuitively, potentially revolutionizing how information is processed and understood in NLP 
applications. Research Method and Design of Overall Architecture 
Qualitative research uses descriptive, exploratory, and explanatory methods in language modelling 
contexts. The techniques track information extraction, entity and dimension recognition, relation 
extraction, and event detection. Figure 1 represents the detailed workflow for extracting concepts and 
their semantic relationships from text chunks within large documents and enabling interactive 
redirection. It has many stages: Multi-Format Input, LLM-centric chunking Alignment, LLM-based 
Interpretative Understanding, Extracted Concept from LLM, URL Integration Techniques, Graph 
Generation, and routing. Multi-Format Input In the domain of graph generation and redirection, they involve handling and processing text inputs 
from various formats, such as DOCX, TXT, and PDF. The text is parsed for DOCX files using (python-
docx — pypi.org, n.d.; python-docx — python-docx 1.1.2 documentation, n.d.) to preserve formatting 
like headings and styles. PDF files are handled using (PyPDF2 — pypi.org, n.d.; Welcome to PyPDF2 —

PyPDF2 documentation, n.d.) for extracting text while managing layout complexities. TXT files are 
processed by directly reading text content. Character encoding considerations ensure text integrity, and 
pre-processing steps like cleaning non-textual elements are applied to maintain accuracy and 
consistency across all formats, preparing the extracted text for subsequent analysis and graph 
generation. Model-Centric Chunking Alignment 
Chunking alignment is facilitated using the long-chain library, configured with Chunk Size and Chunk 
Overlap parameters. This setup ensures efficient segmentation of text data into manageable chunks for 
subsequent LLM-based analysis. The LLM-centric format of the segmented text includes attributes like 
text, source, page, and chunk ID, as shown in Figure 2, essential for maintaining contextual integrity and 
facilitating interpretative understanding through natural language processing techniques. Model-Based Interpretative Insights The segmented text chunks obtained from the previous processing phase are analyzed using an 
examined Large Language Model (LLM), such as GPT-4 or BERT, and a local model, such as LLAMA3 
(Touvron et al., 2023), DSVV fine-tune model (dsvv-cair/alpaca-cleaned-llama-30bbf16· Hugging 
Face — huggingface.co, n.d.) and so on. The LLM performs a comprehensive contextual analysis of each 
text chunk, leveraging its advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. Through this 
analysis, the LLM interprets the semantic content, identifying and extracting key concepts, entities, and 
their interrelationships. Techniques such as entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modelling 
are utilized to derive valuable insights from the text. These insights are then systematically structured 
into nodes and edges, forming the foundational elements for subsequent graph representation. Using an 
LLM ensures high interpretative accuracy, capturing nuanced relationships and contextual 
dependencies within the text. This stage is critical in transforming unstructured text into a structured 
semantic graph, facilitating enhanced interpretability and navigability of the information. Figure 2: Language Model Centric Format

5 Extracting Conceptual Value from Big Data-Guided Large Language Model 
A pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) is employed in this stage to extract and interpret critical 
concepts, entities, and relationships from the segmented text chunks, as shown in Figure 3. The process 
begins by analyzing each chunk to identify meaningful insights, then structuring it into nodes 
(representing entities, nodes, ideas, and events in the spatial domain) and edges (representing the 
relationships between these concepts). This information is organized into a coherent graph structure 
that reflects the semantic relationships derived from the text. To ensure accuracy, the graph is validated 
against the original text and refined by merging similar nodes and eliminating redundant edges. This 
method leverages advanced natural language processing capabilities to create a detailed and navigable 
semantic graph, enhancing the interpretability and accessibility of the extracted information and 
developing instances of semantic graphs. Calculating Contextual Proximity 
Contextual proximity is the assumption that concepts appearing close to each other in a text corpus are 
related. To calculate this, we first transform the data frame by collapsing node_1 and node_2 into a 
single column and then perform a self-join using chunk_id as the key, pairing nodes that co-occur within 
the same text chunk. We remove self-loops by dropping rows where node_1 is equal to node_2. The 
resulting data frame includes a count of co-occurrences and a list of chunk_ids where these occur. By 
merging this with a data frame capturing semantic relations, we create a comprehensive network graph. As shown in Figure 4, we combine the source of the specific node from the specific PDF documents and 
use the page column in the data frame, enhancing traceability. This approach provides a detailed and 
accessible visualization of the relationships between concepts within the text. URL Integration Techniques This stage involves embedding URLs into the nodes and edges of the semantic graph, enabling seamless 
redirection to original content sources. The process begins by associating each extracted concept and its 
relationship with its corresponding section in the original document. Unique URLs are generated for 
these sections using techniques such as anchor tags for HTML documents or page-specific links for 
PDFs. These URLs are then embedded into the graph’s nodes and edges, ensuring that each element in

6 the semantic graph can link back to its original context. This integration enhances user experience by 
allowing direct access to source materials, facilitating in-depth information exploration, and the 
verification method ensures that the semantic graph is a visual representation of relationships and a 
functional navigational tool that bridges the gap between summarized concepts and detailed original 
content. Graph Generation and Routing This stage transforms the structured nodes and edges into an interactive semantic graph visually 
representing the extracted concepts and their relationships. The process begins with graph generation 
tools like NetworkX or Graphviz to create a visual graph layout. Each node represents a concept, and 
each edge represents a relationship plotted to ensure clarity and coherence. Interactive elements are 
integrated into the graph, allowing users to click on nodes and edges to access embedded URLs, which 
redirect to the corresponding sections in the original documents. Routing capabilities are incorporated 
to enhance navigation, enabling users to trace paths between related concepts efficiently. This approach 
ensures that the semantic graph is a static representation and a dynamic tool that facilitates exploration 
and deeper understanding of the textual data. The final output is an intuitive, interactive graph that 
significantly improves the interpretability and usability of the information extracted from the 
documents. Findings - Extraction of Structured Information, LLM Value 
Creation and Evaluation 
Creating value from wide-ranging multimedia data is the focus of the current research. The authors have 
realized the complexity of the data, processing intricacies and interpretation ambiguities in real-world 
business contexts. Increased volumes of data, varieties and variabilities accumulated on different media 
platforms highlight the importance of sophisticated information extraction from unstructured data. Given the heterogeneity of unstructured data volumes, we present a Big Data-trained large language 
model framework for extracting structured information from unstructured data sources. The LLM 
framework generates text in a desired format, maintaining consistency and validating the semantic 
graph outputs. Information extraction, entity and dimension recognition, relation extraction and event 
detection are other valuable features interpreted from the LLM outputs. The framework is adaptable to 
corroborating various graph-structured data with model intrinsic knowledge, usability, and retrieval of 
new insights from big textual data. Figure 5 presents the LLM output model, showing the realized events, which are represented through e-

LLMs can contribute to acquiring data and interpreting relationships, events, and anomalies between 
different textual data patterns, such as alphanumeric characters within words, sentences, and 
paragraphs. The language models can generate new text that is consistent and coherent with the 
concepts and contexts of the domain in which the text is supported. The LLMs can also translate the text 
into different formats. The LLMs have significance in empowering knowledge discovery and creating 
value from large volumes of unstructured data and information. The research audience for creating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is part of Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) teams and information retrieval researchers focused on extracting structured knowledge from big 
textual data. It engages data scientists and machine learning experts working on document parsing, 
knowledge extraction, and knowledge representation from a massive amount of unstructured material. Domain-specific healthcare, finance, and education researchers would benefit from automated KG 
generation to structure vast amounts of document-based data. This research is relevant to a broad 
audience seeking to enhance document understanding, find similarities between documents, and 
explore relationships, content organization, and semantic search across various fields. This paper presents a process for creating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) that visualize the relationships 
between several documents. It makes it possible to convert unstructured data into structured knowledge 
and identify connections and links between different data sources. This paper provides meaningful 
information for semantic search, information retrieval, and multi-document knowledge discovery while 
improving the capacity to validate the connectivity of multiple documents, integrate the extracted data, 
and organize information from different sources. This paper offers a method for building interconnected 
Knowledge Graphs (KGs), making it easier to analyze and apply information in fields that require 
bringing together and connecting large amounts of data with a semantic meaning. Conclusion and Future Work This paper presents a novel approach for constructing and visualizing semantic graphs from multi-
